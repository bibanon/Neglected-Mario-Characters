</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Tanooki </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  J.D.Martin, aka JMycroft<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Tanooki<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Male (We think.  YOU try turning over a six-an-a-half foot tall raccoon!)<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Giant Land<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Kuribo<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Kamek and the Koopas<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Good<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  An enormous raccoon.  Kuribo's pet.  Can fly by whipping his tail around, and can turn
	himself to stone, temporarily.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Born in Giant Land.  Moved to Sky Land, because he can fly, then was caught by Vittorio, 	who named him, and was given to Kuribo as a friendship gift.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  SMB3 (as a fur coat!!!  THAT doesn't sound very good...).  Super Mario Parents.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Unknown.  Last seen with Kuribo.  There is an item in SMB3 called the Tanooki Suit, but
	since there are several of them, they might just be copies (we hope.)<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Like him?  I thought he was pretty original.  He's a gentle, giant woodland creature.  This is
	going to sound silly but here goes:  They say that using his manure to fertilize plants causes

	them to grow leaves that transform people into semi-racoons.  Just a possibility on the origin of
	the Magic Leaf..<BR>
