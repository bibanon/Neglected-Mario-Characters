<B>Description of looks:</B>   A giant guy with three legs and magic shoes (he can walk on 
anything, even Spiny). He wears green clothes.He's short (for a giant), but 
stocky and has a big, stupid grin on his fat face. He wears a giant toupee 
to cover his baldness.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  He was born in Giant World and was
unhappy that everyone was bigger than him. He craved power. So he
moved to Sky World, where everyone was smaller than him. He became
tyrant ruler and crushed anyone who was in his way. One day, though,
a band of renegade Goombas and their leader, Goomba the quick, snuck
into his Spiral Tower while he was sleeping. They made their way to
his palace at the top and took his three giant shoes (Bowser wanted them). 
Kuribo suddenly awakened screaming from his bad dream about Shyguys and 
giant frogs. He spotted the Goombas and went after them. They ran for their 
lives and were about to get in the pipe to get to the ground, when one weak 
Goomba (weaker than the rest) tripped and
fell. Kuribo stepped on the Goomba and slipped on its Goomba mush.
He went tumbling over all of the Goombas except Goomba the Quick,
who had escaped with his mad speed. Kuribo continued to slide on the
Goomba mush until he slid off the edge of the clouds, falling to his
doom. His shoes were taken to a factory by Goomba the Quick, where
Bowser turned them into 3 mechanical shoes for his Goomba army.<BR>
