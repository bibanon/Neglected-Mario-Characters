Question 601: Who would win in a fight; you or Dexter?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Dexter Day Lewis, the boxer?  Can I use my Ice Pick or Deathzooka?  If I can, then Dexter would probably still win.<BR><BR>

Question 602: What are you afraid of? Pick your answer:<BR>
A. Mario<BR>
B. Prof. Executrain<BR>
C. Man-eating monkeys<BR>
D. Alcoholic clowns that eat mayonnaise on a stick<BR>
E. Falling cows<BR>
F. All of the above<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: A,B,C,D,E,F,G.  H,I,J,K, L,M,N,O,P.  Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.  Now I know my A,B,C's, next time...  Er...sorry about that.  My mind slipped for a second.  I've been eating too much yellow corn.  Anyway, I'm not afraid of Mario, since he's an idiot.  I'm not afraid of Prof. Executrain, because I can beat him up on ANY day.  Why would I be scared of man-eating monkeys?  I'm not a man!  I'm a bird!  Although I'm kinda scared of Alcoholic clowns that eat mayonnaise on a stick.  Who wouldn't?  And falling cows are no laughing matter.  SO STOP LAUGHING.  So my answer would be F.<BR><BR>

Question 603: There's this smart, friendly, hot girl a year older than me that I have a crush on, but I don't have a driver's license yet; what do I do?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Show her that you like her by giving her mayonnaise on a stick.  If that doesn't work, approach her, mumble a few things, and then run away really fast.<BR><BR>

Question 604: In NC/SSS Mach 2 part 5, why did Lord Reid send Agent Diet Dr. Thunder? Agent Franken Berry would have been better!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Obviously you underestimate the true power of the Diet Dr. Thunder.<BR><BR>

Question 605: How many spelling/grammar/punctuation errors have I made so far?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Beats me.  Go to school, you bum.<BR><BR>

Question 606: Does Jimmy get paid to crack corn?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: He gets paid per corn he cracks.  I wish I had that kind of sweet job...  I get paid by the decade here.<BR><BR>

Question 607: Does all our base belong to you?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: ...  We really need a secretary in here to screen out the lame questions.  I wonder if Mario has any free time.  That's the kind of mindless job he could handle.<BR><BR>

Question 608: Why does the sign in NC Land say "No Marios"? Why do you guys hate Mario?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: You're new here, aren't you?<BR><BR>

Question 609: How come on the NC homepage, Jay put the Darth Vader theme song? It has nothing to do with NC.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Darth Vader has everything to do with NC.  For you see...Darth Vader...IS MY FATHER.<BR><BR>

Question 610: Ha HA! Dr. Donez, at long last we meet! I have been watching your every 
move on MY sectret camera, hidden away somewhere in your BOX of a home, and 
you think that you are such a big hot shot, because your swelling, 
bum-shaped brain is jam packed with soooooooo much stuff that not even Kings 
or Queens care about...Not that they care about anything much at all...They 
just rule things because people feel sorry for them...BUT, I will be ruler 
of the world, because I AM SMARTER THEN YOU! I KNOW YOUR WEAKNESS! CAPITAL 
LETTER ATTACK! CRUSH HIM! NO ONE HIGHER! NOTHING BETTER THEN PERFECTION! MY 
EVIL LAUGH TOPS YOURS, BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE ONE!!! AH HA, HA, HA, HA, 
HA---*choke choke choke*...!!!!! HA!!!!................Now, if only I could 
remember my question...<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Hello there!  Well, I have a few ideas for how you can remember your question.  I use this method all of the time when I forget something.  First, go buy a hundred gallons of Hawaiian Punch.  Second, play Mario Crash on the Virtual Boy for three straight days.  And presto!  You've remembered everything about everything.  It's useful to use this method before tests, instead of studying.<BR><BR>

Question 611: Alright, I'm gonna try not to do a mental question. You can do it Jimmy. Dr. Donez, can you-<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Yes.<BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: I don't give a cob of corn who you are.<BR><BR>

Question 613: Is it-a Luigi time?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No.  It's never Luigi time.  He never even registered his Gameboy.<BR><BR>

Question 614: Why doesn't Jay get a life and stop making you answer all these horrible and stupid questions? Do you guys have anything going on beyond NC?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I've been asking myself the same thing for years...  I have plenty of stuff to do besides NC.  It's Jay who's keeping us here every day.  FREE US, BOB!  YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE!  Er...your name is Bob, right?<BR><BR>

Question 615: How come Crocker can make 2+2 equal fish?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Because Crocker can do anything, as long as he believed in his heart.<BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: How about we do this instead.  Simply go back to the old questions here, and pick out ten at random.  Or just pick the last ten questions that were asked.  I don't care.  But then answer those.  Knock yourself out.<BR><BR>

Question 624: How much wood could a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck had one tooth?<BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: A helloamunga to you too.<BR><BR>

Question 635: Is it A,B,C, or D?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: The answer to this question is quite complex.  To start, I will begin by offering three points, and three counter points.  First, it is highly unlikely that the cause of the Industrial Revolution was started by the beginnings of an alien invasion of Canadian cows.  Second, who are you to judge the brave men who fought for their country during the great Taco Rebellion of 1874?  And finally, yes, I do accept the nomination of Vice-Secretary of the Plant Food and Car Wash Alliance League.<BR><BR>

Question 636: Everybody loves Raymond. Do YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!<BR>

Question 637: Do u like captin churro (p.s. hes a boy)<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Why, do you work for him?<BR><BR>

Question 638: Fred's Deathly Deathray of Deathly Deathness is, without a doubt, very powerfull. Possibley the most powerfull attack at NC. So why doesn't he use it more often?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Beats me.  Maybe he's forgetful.  Or maybe just lazy.  Or maybe he wants the challenge.  Since it would be a pathetically easy fight if he just used the Deathly Deathray of Deathly Deathness all of the time.  I mean, come on.  What would be the point?<BR><BR>

Question 639: Hey Dr. Donez! Did you master the Absoluteley Nothing move yet? What does it do? Is it powerfull? And what does Bill's The Extra Skill move do?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Yes.  I'm doing Absolutely Nothing right now.  I am indeed a master of that move.  It is very powerful.  It inables me to do Absolutely Nothing whenever I want.  You only wish you could behold such power.<BR><BR>
