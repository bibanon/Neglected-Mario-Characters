2 the male children after the stork deliverd them to their parents they had them sent to the 
real world(like in the cartoons I refer to this world as the real world) were they were found 
by the marios in Brocklin but thier inshurance company only allowed them to take 2 
children so they sent the sisters to their cousions in Racine Wisconson located just south of

<B>Other Comments:</B>  I'v sent you this before but i decided to change some things.
Racine is my home town. I came up with this idea for 2 resons 1 it solves Nintendo
a problem in 1985 games could only have up to 2 players if they could have 4 as
they do now Nintendo would have come up with 2 other bros. and since Mario Games
don't have bros. in the name any more i thout why not sisters and the other reson is
of course their Sexy!<BR>
