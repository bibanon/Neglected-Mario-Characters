Question 147: I was working on my invention called it the Gas ^8 Swath, it was to make me a army of Fred's (evil ones), so i could rule the world. it didn't work. somewhere between the pikachu blood and the supper goltmaight my machine exploded and created a giant pikachu,i called it PikZillia! i tried to controlled it but it destroyed my house. now its on a rampage killing everyone that hates pokemon. is there anyway i can regain control of my monster before it destroys NC?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Hmm...sounds like you have a real problem here.  And thousands of lives are counting on me to answer it in time to stop this monster.  But the sad thing is that I'm on my break at this moment, so you'll have to ask me again later.  Ta ta.<BR><BR>

Question 148: How come everyone who hated the original Mega Man series loved the Mega Man X series?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Frontal Lobotomies.  Either that or its because most people in the world are what we call "Idiots".  These "Idiots" are easily amused by fancy graphics and so only care about the new Mega Man X series because of that fact.<BR><BR>

Question 149: Why is my brother such a jerk?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Is he related to that guy who asked the "Moo?" question?  Maybe there's a connection.<BR><BR>

Question 150: If Captain N had been made now, who would Lana's champions be?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Hmm...I'd say...well, you'd just have to look for the most popular Nintendo characters currently.  So I'd have to say Mario (although I still hate his guts), Link, Kirby and for a forth lets just say Locke from Final Fantasy 6 for no real reason.<BR><BR>
