<CENTER> <H2>  DONKEY KONG  </H2> </CENTER>

<B>  Mario Games he's been in: </B> <BR>
Poor ol' DK hasn't been in too many MARIO games. OK, OK, only 2 really <BR> 
<UL>
<LI>SMK- An OK driver, I would never be caught dead using him.  In SMK64 he was replaced with Wario.
</UL>
<B>  Mario Games he's had a major role in the story: </B> <BR>
DK has caused MARIO so much trouble, hehehe. <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Donkey Kong- FIRST APPEARANCE!!!  Chucked barrels at MARIO for Pauline???  Who knows?
<LI>DK Jr.- DK didn't have much of a role in this one.  He was captured by Mario, but was saved by Donkey Kong Jr.  I guess Nintendo does have a heart.
<LI> DK3- Sorry, don't know much about this game.  I DO know it exist.  Just ask Kyle.  Ya, bug him.
<LI> DK GB- Ultra cool game.  If you have Game Boy, GET IT NOW!!!
</UL>
<B> Non-Mario Games he's been in:</B> <BR>
Because DK was such a popular character, Nintendo gave him his own game.  and another.  and another.  (grumble, I STILL don't see Luigi's own game. @#*$&^*@!#) <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Donkey Kong Country- After many years of being Neglected, this NC FINALLY got his OWN 	SERIES!!!  Oh Ya, he saved his bananas from some pirates.
<LI> DKC2- Well so much for fame, after his first hit he is again put aside for two new stars I'll 	talk of later.  This time HE is captured by pirates.
<LI> DKC3- Don't know much about this one either.  Go bother Kyle.  He knows everything.
<LI> Donkey Kong Land- Game Boy version of DKC.  Pretty cool.
<LI> DKL2- Replica of DKC2.  Exactly.
<LI> DKL3- Take a wild guess what this game is about.  I'll give a special prize to the person with the answer and at least one, cool, NC idea.  Send e-mail to EWJim4@aol.com.
</UL>
<B>  Mario Games he HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
I won't go through all of them, since Kongs aren't really part of the regular Mario cast.  But anyway, he wasn't in any of the primary Mario games. <BR> <BR>
<B>  Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Saved Donkey Kong Country from a bunch of pirates.
<LI> Gets captured by Cap'n K-Rool TWICE, to set up TWO more game titles.  Sound's like Nintendo's kind of hero.
</UL>
<B>  Why People Like Donkey Kong: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Big and Hairy-DK is the male role compared to Princess as the female role mentioned earlier.
<LI> Clothes-Early on he wore absolutely nothing.  Well, he is an ape.  So now Nintendo has upgraded his coverage-to a tie with DK on it.
<LI>  Aditude-He gets anything he wants and I mean ANYTHING.  What I want to see a fight of Bowser vs. Donkey Kong.
<LI>  Anger-When he's mad, he starts chucking barrels.  Simple enough.
<LI> Graphics-Donkey Kong Country had the BEST graphics of it's time.  To me it still has.
</UL>
