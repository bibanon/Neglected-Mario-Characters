<H2><CENTER> Neglected Mario Chracter Name Game #8 </CENTER></H2><BR>
Something new is always good.  Except for new systems...they make fans pay more $$$ for games...anyway there is a new twist to Name Game.  For the pictures with a "*" there is only a part of the character showing.  Name the character as always.  Good Luck.  *HINT*  The Characters are from SMB, SMB2 and SMB3.  One is a Kirby Character.  I'm looking for the Unofficial "Jay Resop" name for this character.  Jay's Difficulty Rating-"Head Scratcher"<BR>
