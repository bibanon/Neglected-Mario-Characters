	One score, and one more year ago (21), King Bowser Koopa and his queen
decided that they needed someone who could rule the emperor after they died so they had
children. Queen Koopa laid 128 eggs!!!! One hatched VERY quickly. This was the first
Koopa kid. You probably are thinking “Ludwig”. You're absolutely WRONG. The first
Koopa kid wasn't named for a while. Ill tell you what happened to him. When he was
one, Bowser was making a glop to put Mario in. What happened was the BABY fell in. It
was a youth potion and the Koopa was made a baby PERMANENTLY. Throughout the
years the other eggs hatched. Bower’s favorite children were Ludwig, his genius son,
Roy, the meanest of the mean, Iggy and Lemmy, the deadly duo, Wendy, the princess
brat, Morton, Jr., bad singer extrodinare (Morton is Bowser’s middle name), and Larry,
Bowser’s younger self. There first, sort of, appearance was SMB2. They wanted to kill
Mario for there dad. So, without him knowing, Ludwig invented a dream machine, which
allowed the Koopas to go into the world of Sub-con. They took some REALLY old
troops and invented some new so there dad wouldn't recognize them. Then, to disguise
themselves even more, they dressed up in funny costumes. Iggy and Lemmy together,
disguised themselves as Wart, the head on the invasion. Unfortunately for them, they lost,
and to make it even more humiliating, by the hands of Princess Peach Toadstool!!!! They
then decided not to make up there own plans. A few years later, Bowser, unknowing of
their earlier plan, asked them to help him out in conquering the Mushroom Kingdom.
The kids agreed. Again though, they lost. A few years later they were asked to help
conquer dinosaur world and...they lost. A LONG time later you looked at game ideas
week 10 game Super Koopa Bros. and that tells the end of this. Will they be in another
game? Will flurries, albastosses, and other troops in SMB2 ever be seen again? Will Jay
put this bio up before they do? Will I ever stop asking such stupid questions? Will the bio
end here? Yes. Join us next week, same Koopa time, same Koopa channel for another bio
by... ME, LEMMY KOOPA!!!!<BR>

<B>Thoughts from Jay</B> <BR>
Ok, Lemmy has been bothering me for a while to put up his bios, so I’m getting them all out of the way.  This is an entertaining bio, though.  Good job.
