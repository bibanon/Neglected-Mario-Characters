<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  After he was born, he wasn't quite sure what to do with himself.  His parents rejected him beacause he wasn't a normal Span.  He looked 30 years old, was fat, short, and had an ugly mustache.  He was left in a dog carrier and brought to the top of secluded tall mountain and left there.  After chewing out of the cage, he started to look for a place to stay.  He saw people having fun down in Span and was just depressed.  One day he went down and saw that he wasn't missing out.  A kid as ugly as him was being made fun of.  Fred the Spanyard.  After acting like an old man to get the kids off of Fred's back, one of the kids parents got ticked and kind of banned him from Span.  He came to Earth and decided to live in Spain.  After 304, he went back to Span, but only to the mountain.  He know yells at everyone down there and is trying to complete the 300 page test to become an neglected character fighter, but keeps failing miserably.<BR>
