<TITLE> Wart </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2>Wart</H2> </CENTER>

<B>The only Mario Game he's been in: </B> <BR>
<UL> 
<LI>SMB:2-This games had Wart's first and, sadly, last appearance.  Wart takes the role of the ruler of a dream world called sub-con with a huge army of Shyguys????? Surreal huh.  This doesn't much sound like a Mario game, but mainly because it was just a port of an old japanese game with Mario char.'s put in. But if it let us have Wart, it was worth it! <BR>
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Stories that need to be told: </B> <BR>
The untold stories that would make great games/comics/books?!?!? <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Wart's Past-Who is he?  How did he become the leader of all those shy-guys. Where is he now?  Why is Bowser in control of the shy-guy's now (Yoshi's Island)?  These things need to be told in some kind of future game/book.
<LI> Wart vs. Bowser- Wouldn't that make a cool game?
<LI> SMB2: The Sequel-Mario travels back to sub-con.  More of the mysteries of the first hit are revealed (was it all a dream?).
</UL>
<B>Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
Well, heroism is a stretch, but... <BR>
<UL>
<LI> HE'S ONLY IN ONE GAME!!!  Not many Mario characters have done this and still received as much popularity as Wart has.
<LI> Took over Bowser's role-Something difficult to accomplish. (Only Smithy (SMRPG) shares the honor)
<LI> He was only in one game, yet his Shy-guys & bob-ombs continue to be seen in games.  Is that strange or what?
<LI> What ever happened to his minions, Mouser and Triclyde? Weren't they cool bosses.
</UL>
<B>Why People Like Wart </B> <BR>
The little things that make a bit player so loved <BR>
<UL>
<LI> He HATES veggies-Just like every kid
<LI> HE WAS ONLY IN ONE GAME!!!-People feel sorry for him.
<LI> Mysterious Past? - I still want to know where Bowser was during this time. (making the koopa kids -Kyle)
<LI> He's a frog-Originality rarely seen in Mario bosses (until SMRPG)
<LI> Lastly, because of his helpful stupidity-He doesn't like vegetables, yet has a veggie maker in his room!!! Why???
</UL>
