<CENTER> <H2>  KING BOWSER KOOPA  </H2> </CENTER>

<B> Mario Games he's been in: </B> <BR>
This list will be small mainly 'cause Bowser is the bad guy in most games.
<UL>
<LI> SMK/SMK 64- He's so big and mean he can mow others down!  Diabolical laugh-HAHAHAHAH
<LI> Super Mario RPG- Defiantly the best touch to the game.  Humor value to the extreme
</UL>
<B> Mario Games he's had a major role in the story </B> <BR>
Time after time Bowser has been the victim of MARIO.  One games I'd like to see Bowser give MARIO a REAL challenge.  Bowser would have an easy time beating up MARIO, but Nintendo has him under protection.  Anyway, here's the list.
<UL>
<LI> SMB-Took the Princess.  Fairly simple
<LI> SMB:3- Took the Princess AND tries to take over the Mushroom Worlds. Hay, who wouldn't?
<LI> SMW- Took the Princess AND tries to take over Dinosaur Land.  Why? Because he can!
<LI> SMW2:YI- This time Bowser is really Kamek's stooge. But he sooo cute as a baby.
<LI> SM64- Took the Princess AND tries to take over the princess' castle.  BORING!
<LI> SMRPG- Like princess, he was in so much of the story, I had to put his here.  Humor to extreme.
</UL>
<B> Mario Games he HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
These are the games where Nintendo didn't feel they needed the Koopa King to bring trouble to Mario. 
<UL>
<LI> SMB:2-Took place in Mario's dream, so forgivable. But why would Mario dream about Wart rather than Bowser?
<LI> SML: 1-3-This was Wario's problems with MARIO.  Bowser was doing other evil stuff
</UL>
<B> Forgotten Heroism: </B><BR>
It's just info about Bowser and reasons he has been neglected.
<UL>
<LI> Helped save the Kingdom from Smithy.
<LI> HAY!  BOWSER ISN'T A HERO! HE'S A BIG, UGLY, TYRANT, WHO THE LEADER OF A DEMONIC HORDE OF TURTLES THAT ARE AT WAR WITH  A BUNCH OF PLUMBERS AND STINK'EN MUSHROOMS!  HAHAHAHAHAHAH!
<LI> Uh, did I mention he saved Mushroom Kingdom from Smithy?
</UL>
<B> Why People Like Bowser: </B> <BR>
Why do people like the king of all turtles?
<UL>
<LI> Reputation- No one gets in his way. Or else!
<LI> Royalty- He's a king.  A POWERFUL king.
<LI> Spiked Shell Back- Why doesn't he just sit on Mario or something?
<LI> Pity- He just never wins.  Sniff.
<LI> He's BIG- Who would you rather be friends with, a plumber who has had too much pasta, or a big, scary reptile?
</UL>
