	Currently, we know nothing of Toad's past history, similarly to most Neglected Characters.  We do know that is one of the higher ranking members in the Mushroom government.  Some government!!  If they really existed, they would have been wiped out long ago.  It's quite simple-Kingdoms are dead.  They don't work.  The UK isn't really a Kingdom anymore, so it doesn't count.  The Mushrooms should start a Democratic government.  It's much more efficient.  At least they aren't Communist or a Dictatorship.  Now, let me go over with you the fine points of a Democracy.  (Reader-What in all of heck are you talking about?  Jay-I was just going to teach you a little about Democ...  Reader-Shut up and get back to work, I want you to talk about Toad.  Jay-Yes sir.)  <BR> <BR>
OK, back to Toad.  In the Mushroom Kingdom, Toad's job is the royal retainer.  Basically he's like a diplomat.  Then one day along came the main plot characters-Mario, Luigi, and Bowser.  Being the "bad guy"<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top">, Bowser started a war with the Mushroom Kingdom with his army of turtles.  Toad, trying his best to prevent war, held negotiations with Bowser.  Bowser responded to this by laughing, kidnapping Toad, taking Princess Toadstool, and started the war against the Mushrooms.  This sets up the scene for Super Mario Bros.  To keep things short, the Luigi Bros.<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"> came to the Mushroom Kingdom, saved Toad, and saved his job of running around the country to ensure peace to all mushrooms. He also saved the princess, and defeated Bowser, but that's another bio. <BR> <BR>
Toad was so impressed with the heroism of the Luigi Bros.<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top">, that he spent all of his time with them in hopes to be more like Mario<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top">.  Later in Subcon, Toad fought side by side with the Luigi Bros.<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"> against the evil henchman-Wart. Toad proved very useful with his speed and agility.  In Super Mario Bros. 3, although Toad did not have an active role in the game, he proved again to be a necessity.  To aid Mario and Luigi with their second fight against Bowser, he followed them all over the world giving them items when the Luigi Bros.<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"> were in need of help.  Even in Super Mario 64, he helped Mario<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"> whenever he could lend a hand. <BR> <BR>
	So, I hope you all learned a little more about the true hero of the Super Mario Kingdom.  He faces danger, never gives up, and will travel anywhere just to lend a hand.  He is waiting right now in the Mushroom Kingdom<IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="star.html" height="10" width="10" ALIGN="top"> for the next time Bowser may strike. <BR>
