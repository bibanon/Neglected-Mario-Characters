<TITLE> Yoshi </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2>Yoshi</H2> </CENTER>
<B>Mario Games he has been in: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> SMW- First appearance! Mario rode him through levels, ate stuff, and added humor AND fun to the game.
<LI> SMW2:YI- STAR ROLE!!!  Saved Mario from baby Bowser and Kamek.  Beautiful graphics.  I enjoy them much more than Mario 64. (<----controversy time -Kyle)
<LI> Yoshi- An OK puzzle game.  The first Yoshi appearance on NES!!!
<LI> Yoshi's Cookie- I don't know, I never played it.  Heard it wasn't good though. Has almost nothing to do with Yoshi, just a cameo .  Also a puzzle game.
<LI> Tetris Attack- Also has little to do with Yoshi.  Based on pictures from YI.  Never played it.  A third puzzle game for the dino.  Sheesh.
<LI> Yoshi's Safari- A pitiful attempt by Nintendo to increase Super Scope sales.  Never played it.
<LI> SM64- A SMALL CAMEO!!!  THAT'S IT!!!  WHY WOULD ANYONE NEED 100 LIVES AFTER 	THEY HAVE ALL THE STARS!!!  THIS IS WHY I DO NOT HAVE A N64 YET!!!  NO 	LUIGI, NOT MUCH YOSHI!!!  BAD, BAD, NINTENDO!!!  A major disappointment for all neglected char. fans.
</UL>
<B>Stories that need to be told: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Yoshi's life- What is he?  Why is he in so many colors?  What is the Yoshi village and way of life like?  What kind of government do they have?
<LI> What was Nintendo thinking?- What kind of a mind would create a friendly, green, talking dino with a bottomless stomach for Mario to ride?
<LI> Yoshi vs. Kirby- The ULTIMATE fight!  The bottomless pit vs. the bottomless pit.  Sorry Yoshi fans, but I have to go with Kirby.  Kirby is SO much cooler.  Kirby may even beat Luigi as 	my favorite Nintendo character.  I have ALL of the Kirby games (except for stupid ones like Avalanche).  I would bet easy money Kirby would win.  If any of you don't think so, then there is no use complaining-you're wrong. (<---- more controversy -Kyle)
</UL>
<B>Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Hard worker- Yoshi does ALL the work when Mario rides him!  He runs, eats, flys, and all Mario does is sit!
<LI> Saved Mario from Kamek and Baby Bowser, and got NO THANKS FROM MARIO!!!  All Mario did was CRY!!!  What a baby.
<LI> Uh, supplied Nintendo with three, uh, great puzzle appearances.
<LI> Gave Mario lives in N64.  Gives players pride in finding him.
<LI> The Yellow, and Red Yoshis are just as cool as the Blue Yoshi in SMW.  I always stand up for the Neglected.
<LI> The Blue Yoshi was NEVER in World 6 of YI!!!  He was replaced by the regular Green Yoshi for the last fight with Bowser.  It makes sense, but he deserves some credit.
</UL>
<B>Why people like Yoshi: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> He's a Dinosaur- People like dinos, right?  Especially cool dinos.
<LI> He eats- and eats, and eats, and eats... and never gets full.  Sometimes cool things happen when he eats (poops out mushrooms).
<LI> He's scared of ghosts- Just like most kids. He'll never go into a ghost house.
<LI> Yoshi's Island- The BEST game on Super Nintendo and possible ALL other systems.  That is a little exaggeration but still a GREAT game!  I bought it even after I beat Kyle's copy to death. (<----literally -Kyle)
<LI> Adds Humor- Why do you think SMW was so popular and fun? Yoshi!  Why did Nintendo make a sequel? Yoshi!  Who was the sequel based on? Yoshi!  I rest my case.
</UL>
Well, that's it kids!  I hope you enjoyed my take on the world of Neglected Characters in the Mario Kingdom!  I you have ANY more ideas, send me them, and I might use them.  You have already been warned-one-timers are too hard.  I may try one eventually, but first-NCBIO's!!!.  This new series, which I already began, will be short stories on ALL the Neglected Characters-Even One-Timers!!!<BR
P.S. I want to thank NESter for sending me the NCBio idea, during the time I was looking for a replacement for the regular NC's when the list of NC's was running low.<BR>
