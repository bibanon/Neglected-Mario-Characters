Poser: We have ourselves one heck of a patriotic match tonight!<br>
Orlando: The former presidents of NC duke it out to see who is the best!<br>
<p>
<img src="dm2/dm1.PNG" align="left">
Poser: In the left corner, we have Bill, the first NC president!<br>
Orlando: In the right corner, we have Churro, who was the second NC president... and until recently, the most unusual president!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm2.PNG" align="left">
Poser: For extra patriotic action, we've used the old debate floor as an arena!<br>
Orlando: Are you sure that's a good idea, Poser?<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm3.PNG" align="left">
Poser: I'm sure nothing bad will happen.<br>
Orlando: Aaaand Bill goes to end the match early with an Extra Move!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm4.PNG" align="left">
Poser: But that's not allowed, Lyle!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm5.PNG" align="left">
Poser: Fred tries to give the match to Bill!<br>
Orlando: It's obvious who the winner i--WHAT THE???<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm6.PNG" align="left">
Poser: In a Deathmatch, and maybe NC first, someone has survived the Extra Move!<br>
Orlando: How shocking!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm7.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: Churro says some seemingly magical words...<br clear="all">


<img src="dm2/dm8.PNG" align="left">
Poser: I don't see anything happening, Lyle.<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm9.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: Maybe we should call the match for Bill...<br clear="all"> 

<img src="dm2/dm10.PNG" align="left">
Poser: AND THE ARENA IS HIT BY A SPACE-TIME DISTURBANCE!!!<br>
Orlando: Just look at that... this has been the most improbable Deathmatch of the century!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm11.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: ...He messed up the arena, Poser.<br>
Poser: It isn't my fault! It isn't my fault! YOU wanted this arena!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm12.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: No I didn't! I wanted Big Blue!<br>
Poser: Big Blue? ...It doesn't matter. We're both in trouble if Metal Man finds out!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm13.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: The match continues as--<br>
Poser: Enough of the match, Orlando. We've got to make sure we aren't fired!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm2/dm14.PNG" align="left">
Poser: Let's say... Bill did it!<br>
Orlando: Fine! ...Look, you doofus! We nearly missed another rare occurrence... two Extra Moves at once!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm15.PNG" align="left">Poser: Oh no, not the stage-damaging warp again!<br>
Orlando: You better have a good alibi, Poser!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm16.PNG" align="left">Poser: Don't worry, I've just sent the picture of Bill using a dangerous technique... ...alongside some images of Bill's anti-Metal Man ads.<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm17.PNG" align="left">Orlando: But Bill never made any--<br>
Poser: Quiet! I pasted them together over old ads! Now let's finish commentating!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm18.PNG" align="left">Poser: Whoa! In the time we spent talking, things have become dire.<br>
Orlando: This is all your fault, Poser. The match should have been ended... by us... a round or two ago!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm19.PNG" align="left">Poser: Whoops!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm20.PNG" align="left">Orlando: ...Well, that was unexpected.<br>
Poser: Saved by the Bell!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm21.PNG" align="left">Orlando: You monster! No one liked that show!<br>
Poser: SHHH! The match actually finished!<br>
Orlando: Oh... uh... this is the Deathmatch commentators, signing out!<br>
Poser: Don't tell anyone made of steel about this or... ....goodbye! *VANISH*<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm22.PNG" align="left"><br clear="all">
<img src="dm2/dm23.PNG" align="left"><br clear="all">
Poser: ...Maybe I overdid the alibi...<br>
