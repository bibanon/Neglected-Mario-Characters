<B> Mario Games he's been in: </B> <BR>
These are the games where Toad has had an active role.  Not much, is it?
<UL>
<LI> SMB:2- Selected from a team of four
<LI> Mario Kart/Mario Kart64- He was a pretty good driver, with THE BEST handling.
<LI>Mario's Dream Tennis- The fastest of the eight selectable, I believe.
<LI> Wario's Woods-LEAD ROLE!!! Fighting Wario for control of the, um, woods.
</UL>
<B> Mario Games he's had a major role in the story: </B> <BR>
 Although Toad has not been in very many active roles, in most games he has had a large part in the story.
<UL>
<LI> SMB- The final mushroom in World 7 was Toad. All the others were related to him 
<LI> SMB:3- Toad's Mushroom House o' Goodies! Also the card game and such
<LI> Super Mario RPG-Toad had a HUGE story line role in this.  Besides being a beginner tutor, he was VERY helpful throughout the game.
<LI> SM64- Gives you some free stars and helps with the game.
</UL>
<B> Mario Games he HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
These are the games where Nintendo choose NOT to put in the mushroom helper Toad, and why.
<UL>
<LI> SMW- Different land
<LI> SMW:2-Different time
<LI> SML:1-3- I guess, many people were not in this game
</UL>
<B> Forgotten Heroism: </B><BR>
Info. about Toad and reasons he has been neglected.
<UL>
<LI> He runs around Mushroom Kingdom/World to help Mario throughout his quest.  Shouldn't Mario, the great hero, be able to get along by himself?
<LI> He had a decent character in both SMB:2, dream Tennis, and Mario Kart.  Fast, agile, nimble, are these the character traits of a hero or what?
<LI> He's one of the higher ranking Mushroom officials on the entire Mushroom Kingdom.  Pretty cool job if you ask me.
<LI> He usually supplies Mario with Items though out the game.  The net time you use a Super Leaf in SMB:3, remember where you got it.
<LI> Anyone who's ever read the Mario comics or books knows it's Toad that always saves everyones butt.

</UL>
<B>Why People Like Toad: </B> <BR>
Why do people like this lovable 'shroom?  Here's why!
<UL>
<LI> He's got a Mushroom for a head, instant protection againced the rain.  Too bad I don't have a hat like that.
<LI> Royalty-Who doesn't like someone in charge.
<LI> Loyalty-He's always there for Mario.  Running after him, dodging Koopa Klan members, and just to give him a power up.  Wow.
<LI> Cothes- The pant/vest combo is so trendy
<LI> Popular- All the mushroom people thoughout the games are simply refered to as Toad. Wow.
<LI> Don't you just love it how in world one of SMB:3 Toad supplies you with 2 whistles and a P-wing?
<LI> He's short and just plain lovable.
</UL>
