<TITLE> Diddy Kong </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2>  Diddy Kong   </H2> </CENTER>

<B>  Mario Games he's been in:</B> <BR>
None.  Not one Mario game. <BR> <BR>

<B> Mario Games he's had a major role in the story: </B> <BR>
Again, not one game.  We need a good Mario/DK crossover. <BR> <BR>

 <B> Non-Mario Games he's been in:</B><BR>
OK, here we go.  Because Diddy was introduced as a DK character, only DK games he has been in so far.<BR>
<UL>
<LI> DKC- FIRST APPEARANCE!!!  Acted as a second player along with Donkey Kong.
<LI> DKC2- STAR ROLE!!!  This time Diddy takes his first shot at stardom and saves DK from the 	same pirates.
<LI> DKC3- I donno, he was captured along with DK.  Saved by Dixie (Who I'll talk about later) and 	some other guy.  Sorry, but I never got the game.
<LI> DKL1-3- Sorry for the rush, but these games are EXACTLY like their country counterparts.
<LI> Diddy Kong Racing- ANOTHER STAR ROLE!!!  This time is a SMK wanna be.  But it's getting 	some pretty good reviews.
</UL>
<B>  Mario Games he HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
See Donkey Kong <BR> <BR>

<B>  Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Saved DK's bananas from pirates.
<LI> Saved DK from pirates.
<LI> One of three new characters (I'm counting Wario and surprise) to be popular with other Mario freaks.  A great step for Neglected Characters around the world.
<LI> Was it just me or was anyone else annoyed when a Nintendo freak saw DKC for the first time and said, "Hey, is he Donkey Kong Jr.?"  Poor Diddy.  No one knew who he was.
</UL>
<B>  Why People Like Diddy Kong: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> He's cool-That hat, so hypnotic.
<LI> Popularity-Like I said before, he is one of the only Nintendo characters to become popular so fast.
<LI> The BEST character in the DKC series-Donkey Kong is too slow, Dixie is too wimpy, and that other guy I don't really care about.  Diddy is fast, can hold barrels in front of him, is small, and can jump the highest.  If you want to argue, go ahead.
</UL>
