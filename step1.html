There are two ways to get the pictures.  You can head over to your favorite video game sites and download the pictures however this A) gets you a lot of enemies and B) limits the pictures you can use.  But the better way of getting pictures is heading over to your local emulation site and download and emulator and games and get a wider variety of pictures without become bitter rivals with someone.  Emulators are considered illegal if you don't own the original game and console.  But no one really cares.  There's two sites you must visit to get everything you need for your emulating needs.  For the emualtors go to www.emulazone.com and go to www.plasticman.org/emu for the games.  First head to the EmulaZone(www.emulazone.com) and click 'Emulators'.  You will come to a page asking what system you want.  You will probably want emualtors for the NES, SNES and Sega Genesis(in case you want Mario to harass Sonic the Hedgehog or something).  If you want to, download the Game Boy.  When downloading, make sure the operating system matches your computer or else you will be terribly frustrated.  Mamma mia, there's a lot to choose from!  My reccomendations are:<BR>
<BR>
NES- They say NESticle is the absolute best one there is, but I prefer NESten.  The name isn't so dirty, the cursor isn't a severed, bleeding hand(whoever made NESticle needs to get their mind out of the gutter) and I don't find it any harder to use.  Download NESten.<BR>
<BR>
SNES- ZNES all the way!  Unlike NES emulators, nothing can compete with ZNES.  Download ZNES.<BR>
<BR>
Genesis- I haven't been around the block much on Genesis emulators.  I use Gens which is very easy to use except I don't know how to get the Game Genie to work.  Take Gens<BR>
<BR>
Game Boy- I have two Game Boy emulators.  One is called No$GMB and the other is called Rew.  No$GMB has the Game Genie/GamesharK function Rew doesn't but Rew can play Game Boy Color games with better color without charging you money (No$GMB is not a good name for the emulator appearantly).  Rew isn't availible at the EmulaZone.  I won't be discussing Game Boy emulation much and they're harder to use than other emulators, so I reccomend you wait until you're experienced enough with emulators before trying one. But if you're desperate, take No$GMB and search for Rew later.<BR>

When you download the emulators, they are usually in .zip format.  You'll need Winzip to unzip these files.  Most computers now-a-days come with this program pre-installed but if you don't download it from the Winzip home page.  If you don't want to go through all that and you're using AOL, try E-Mailing it to yourself then downloading it again.  It should automatically unzip when you sign off.<BR>
