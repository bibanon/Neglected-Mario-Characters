<H2><CENTER>Ask Dr. Donez! </H2></CENTER><BR><BR>

Question 51: Dr. I am having some trouble with it....what should i do?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: All answers can be found in Dr. Donez's Book of Love, only $199.99!<BR><BR>

Question 52: What time does the program on the Discovery channel that teaches you the extra move.
will you teach me the extra warp!!!!!!????<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I think that particular program was only shown once, back in '69.  Sorry about that.<BR><BR>

Question 53: In Bill's bio, it said he was locked up in Sub-con for several years.
Were you put in the same detension cell, or did they put you in solitary confinment? And how did you get out?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Yeah, like the rest of the Sub-conians, I was locked up by Nintendo after the end of SMB2.  I was able to escape before Bill, but I forgot exactly how...maybe it'll come to me later.<BR><BR>

Question 54:  In question 139, it says where would you burry survivors. why would you burry survivors if they're the people who live? Isn't that like...Murder?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Yes, on second review of the question on question, it was a trick question.  Any questions?<BR><BR>

Question 55: In question in 142, how can you marry your widows sister? If she is a widow, that means that the husband died. I don't think he could marry her if he was dead. That's just wrong and sick and I would say some other stuff but this is long enough.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Another trick question.  Dang those trick questions!<BR><BR>

Question 56: Am I smart?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I guess if you figured out thsoe trick questions.<BR><BR>

Question 57: Did you answer yes to my "Am I smart" question? You better have said yes. I am the president, just don't go looking for me, k?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, I didn't really say yes...wait, you're the President of what?<BR><BR>

Question 58: Do you like anime? If you are inferior, anime stands for Japanese animation. It is really cool.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Being a super-intelligent Doctor, I hardly have time for TV, but Anime is alright, at least some Anime.<BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: OK...moving on...<BR><BR>

Question 60: How many beans make five? And why is your mask so stingy? Buy a new one, ya little bird Tweeter thing!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...five?  And no!  I like my mask.  Plus I don't know how to get it off...<BR><BR>

Question 61: How can Fred be a neglected MARIO character if he's not even from a Mario game? He's in Kirby!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Come on, Fred hasn't been in even ONE Mario game!  Thats pretty dang Neglected!<BR><BR>

Question 62: What kind of name for a clown is Rudy?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: A dumb name.<BR><BR>

Question 63: Could you do me a favor and misprove my existance?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: OK, this usually isn't too hard.  Lets say that your life is this billiard ball.  Now, lets say that your soul, represented by this bag of walnuts, gets eaten by the Realm of Minunderestimization.  By bringing your Cheeto value to Negative Four, you do not exist anymore.  Congratulations.<BR><BR>

Question 64: Why not?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Yes.<BR><BR>

Question 65: How come the Block Busters were I live are so cruddy?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: The next time you go to your Blockbusters, check the name a second time.  If it says "McDonalds", there is your answer.<BR><BR>

Question 66: When the heck will Jay use one of my comix or AT LEAST use Bob the Bartender?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I don't know, Jay gets pretty dang lazy sometimes.  But don't tell him I said that.<BR><BR>

Question 67: Whatever happened to Phone the Clone?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Phone the Clone?  Oh, that guy from the Mushroom Wars.  Well, after the series and the world blew up, Phone disappeared for a while.  Recently, however, he has turned up in the service of Jay Respo in the Bill and Fred series.<BR><BR>

Question 68: Why does Jay Respo want the destruction of the $100,000 Pyramid?<BR>

Question 69: Dr. Donez, where (and how) did you get you get your PHD?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, I got my law degree at BUM, along with Fred.  I forgot were I got most of my PHDs, but I know I got most of them at Cow Tech.<BR><BR>

Question 70: How come NC has so many neglected characters in it?<BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: Hey, Jay's not answering these questions, I am!  And I came from Super Mario Bros. 2.<BR><BR>

Question 74: If we have iron in our blood, how come magnets don't stick to us?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...lets see...well now...  I'd have to say that the answer is...that there is so little blood in your body, that it doesn't matter.  Either that or the magnetic power of the iron is de-activated by drinking a lot of milk.  So drink your milk or you'll become magnetic.<BR><BR>

Question 75: If members of the Senate can't be impeached, how do they get rid of someone with the efficiency at the job as a one-legged man at a butt-kicking contest?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, if that one-legged man had a really big sword, then he'd do great in a butt-kicking contest?  But actually, Senators can be impeached from office, just like the President.<BR><BR>
