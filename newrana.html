<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  A robotic frog created by Bowser himself. This was one of Bowser's best creations! This robot could jump very high and shoot water out of it's mouth. It could also slap it's enemies to death. It was of course water proof. It was designed to be able to swim and walk on the land. It also has a big pack of water inside it. When it fires water, and runs out, It takes a little while for it to regenerate some more. Hides in the water and waits for mario to swim by, then attacks!!!<BR>
