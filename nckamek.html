<B>Mario Games he has been in: </B><BR>
Ah, NCs, I remember these.  OK, time to start of with a cool character I forgot.  Another one-timer, but cool.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>  Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island-Had more of a role in this game than Bowser.  You never fought him, but he always used some weird special effects to make the enemy really big.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Mario Games he COULD of been in: </B><BR>
There are many games that had reference to Kamek in one was or another, so should of had him in the game.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>  Super Mario World-OK, I know it’s came out before YI, but with magikoopas, Kamek should of been there.<BR>
<LI> Yoshi’s Story-It’s sort of like a continuation on YI, with baby Bowser.  Why not Kamek???<BR>
</UL>
<B>Stories that need to be told: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>  Backround-WHO THE HECK IS HE???<BR>
<LI>  The meeing of Kamek and Bowser-I think I told the correct story in my Kamek Bio, but Nintendo needs to give us a LITTTLE backround.<BR>
<LI>  History of Magikoopas-Where did they get those cool powers...<BR>
</UL>
<B>Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>  Started Magikoopa school (?)<BR>
<LI>  Trained Bowser to bo the cool boss he is today.<BR>
<LI> Um...hmm....welll...OK...no more comments.
</UL>
<B>Why People Like Kamek:</B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>  He flys-Doesn’t everyone want to fly?  Well, don’t you???  Nevermind.<BR>
<LI>  His broom-Really sweeps up the competition doesn’t it...eh...<BR>
<LI>  Mysterious-Has been a major character in only one game!  When will he be back?<BR>
<LI>  The way he talks-Due to the inferior SNES (sniff), Kamek sounded like a drunk frog.  Hey, Mario doesn’t sound any better on the N64.<BR>
</UL>
