<P>CodieKitty: This was a comic I did with Jay Resop of Neglected Mario Characters ages ago, i.e. back when Neglected Mario Characters was still his site. At its core it's about some Luigi and some other guys going after Mario who's being evil, only the plot has more twists and sidetracks than a Fusilli macaroni art of the New York metro system. I was kind of embarrassed to look at it for the longest time, but looking at it now it's actually kind of cute sometimes and has its moments. But it seemed like Jay was doing most of the funny stuff, while I was generally being shit. His comics were originally hosted on his site, but this series isn't listed on the NC comics anymore for some reason, so I decided to convert them here.</P></CENTER>
