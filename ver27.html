Croco isn't all a bad guy- he just likes stealing things. But how come<BR>
he has that hobby? Come and let me tell you the story of Croco and his<BR>
best friends.<BR>
Croco and his friend Belome liked one thing more than any other thing-<BR>
Super Mario games. They had played them for all of their lives. Then,<BR>
one day, a tragic thing happened- Croco's TV set was stolen! Croco and<BR>
Belome set out to find the crook, only to get beat up by three bandits!<BR>
Croco thought, "Hey, these guys have a good hobby!" So Croco told them<BR>
that if they gave back his TV, he helped them steal things. The bandits<BR>
agreed to this.<BR>
Then came the day of Smithy. Smithy started controlling Croco's mind;<BR>
and he told him to steal from Mario and Mallow! He did the same with<BR>
Belome. He also gave Belome a taste for marshmellows. Croco's head was<BR>
cleared after the Moleville incident, but Belome had to be destroyed for<BR>
that to happen. Croco was determined to get revenge on Mallow. Then he<BR>
remembered that Mallow looked like a cloud. "Maybe he is from Nimbus<BR>
Land and the long-lost Prince Mallow? Maybe, I could steal from his<BR>
people!" So he tried that, but he lost his Signal Ring in the process.<BR>
Giving up, he started selling items to Mario to help them.<BR>
After that, Croco gave up stealing. His henchmen did the same. They<BR>
decided to learn the art of magic instead. Then Croco found a spell<BR>
known as "Life 2." BRAINSTORM: He could bring back Belome! He did that.<BR>
The five became friends again and started a job: testing their favorite<BR>
thing: NINTENDO GAMES!<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Thoughts From Jay</B> <BR><BR>
Great, This sure does clear up all the confusing parts about the game, Super MaRPGio.  Cool bio, and we learn a valuable moral.  Let one man steal your stuff, and never steal no more.  Think about that one for a while.<BR>
