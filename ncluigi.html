</HEAD><BR>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" ><BR>
<CENTER> <H2>  Luigi </H2> </CENTER><BR>
<P>
<B> Mario Games he's been in: </B> <BR><BR>
These are the games where Luigi has had an active role.  He plays most of them as the 2nd player. <BR><BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI>SMB- 2nd player<BR>
<LI>SMB:2- Shared with Mario, princess & Toad<BR>
<LI>SMB:3- 2nd player<BR>
<LI>SMW- 2nd player<BR>
<LI>SMB2(jap) 2nd player<BR>
<LI>Mario is Missing- LEAD ROLE!!!<BR>
<LI>Mario's time machine- Shared ROLE!<BR>
<LI>Mario Kart/Mario Kart 64- I guess you can count these<BR>
</UL><BR>
<B> Mario Games he HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR><BR>
These are the Mario games where Nintendo choose NOT to put in the younger Mario brother. <BR><BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI>SMW2:YI-A small cameo at the end-Mario saved him<BR>
<LI>Super Mario RPG- I still have no idea why (Marsh)Mallow was in this and not Luigi<BR>
<LI>SM64- In this game he wasn't even mentioned!  I guess Nintendo got lazy and "forgot" to add a second player<BR>
<LI>SML- I can forgive this one, it was made by a different team<BR>
<LI>SML2- There is no excuse for this one, It should have had Luigi<BR>
<LI>SML3: Wario Land- I can forgive this one too, because even Mario was only in it for a small part at the end.<BR>
</UL><BR>
<B> Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR><BR>
Why Luigi is much better than that other guy! Also, Mario stole the spotlight from his brother!<BR><BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI> He is slimmer, taller, and can jump higher, then his hefty sibling Mario. <BR>
<LI>In SMB:2 he was obviously the best player-he could jump the farthest. <BR>
<LI>Again in the Lost Levels he was the better player because of his jumping  ability. <BR>
<LI>When you best a Mario game as Luigi, it ALWAYS says "Thank you Mario..." <BR>
<LI>In other words if you do ANYTHING with Luigi, Mario always gets the praise. <BR>
<LI>If any of you read the Mario comics who is always the hero-<I> Mario. </I> <BR>
<LI>Luigi is Mario's younger brother (I guess to cover up the fact that Luigi is  better)<BR>
</UL><BR>
<BR><BR>
<B> Why people like Luigi </B> <BR><BR>
I noticed that many people have an irrational love for Luigi. Why?<BR>
<UL><BR>
<LI> Pity- They feel bad that Mario hogs the attention.<BR>
<LI> They can relate- Many were pushed around by their brother like Luigi has been.<BR>
<LI> The green suit- Has a hypnotizing effect on people!<BR>
<LI> His jumping ability- We all want to fly, and Luigi comes so close...<BR>
<LI> His personality- He takes everything his bro. dishes out without complaining once!<BR>
</UL><BR>
