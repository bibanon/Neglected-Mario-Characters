<Center>Due to lack of support, The Neglected Nintendo Characters Page is no more.  It was fun while it lasted...wait, who am i kidding, it wasn't fun at all.  But Jay's OTHER page (the good one), Neglected Mario Characters, is still running and is funnier then ever.  So go now so you won't miss out.-jay</Center><BR>
