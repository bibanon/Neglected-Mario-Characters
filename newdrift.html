<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  After Super Mario 64, Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach returned to Dinosaur Island for a nice vacation. When there, they met Drift. Drift liked the way Mario and Luigi dressed up and invited them to help him have world domination. Of course, the brothers refused. Drift got so mad that he picked up Princess Peach and ran off with her, jumping into Soda Lake. Now Drift was afraid of water (I'm not sure why), so he ran out and threw the princess to Mario. Luckily, Mario grabbed her, and they could all have a nice vacation. Drift, though, returned to Bowser's lair and got scolded.<BR>
