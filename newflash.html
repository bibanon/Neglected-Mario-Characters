<B>Description of looks:</B>  Like the Koopalings, But has an " F " cap on and a spike on head.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  He was born on the Stardust Trail by Reeno Koopa. He later got lost and ended up on Mushroom KIngdom. Mario saved him 2 times, so he joined. As he got older his Spike got bigger, making him stronger than Ludwig. Some people ( Like Me ) call him RhinoFlash.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  He has great attack power, awesome stamina, not-too-good defense, but he can pull himself out of his shell and throw it like a boomerang. He gets all of the respect like Mario in the Mushroom Kingdom. He has his own Lightsaber that Qui-Gon Jinn gave him. He is very afraid of Evar ( the boss of Stardeath Trail ). He likes woman alot. He loves the dark ( his eyes glow in the dark ). He is a great swimmer. He is very fast, he jumps higher than Luigi, but has poor head strength. His Spike on top of his head is STRONG!!!!! He is a fantastic sidekick. He will let you ride on his shell! Yoshi uses his toungue to "kill" enemies, while RhinoFlash uses his spike! He gets paid $100.000.000 dollars an hour!!<BR>
