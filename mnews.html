<UL><LI>New Short, just so it appears that NC is being updated regularly.  Heh.  I'm finished with the school semester now, so expect something big over the next month.  And if nothing big happens...then, well, you can yell at me.  Heh.  Happy Holidays!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/9/04<BR>
<UL><LI>New e-mail questions from Ask Dr. Donez are answered!  Also, new Short.  I'll be busy for the next week or so as I finish up the semester.  I may be able to make one or two Shorts, but expect bigger projects to be done in the new year.  Aka the next episode of Lord of the Wings.  Hope you all have a good holiday!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/29/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Yay.  Short.  Also, your homework is to look up the word "defenestrate" in the dictionary, and to use it in a sentence.  If you do, you get one gold star.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/23/04<BR>
<UL><LI>New Short.  If you don't like it, well, too bad.  Well, if you don't like it, also updated is the NC Election 2004 site, which has a lot of new candidate posters.  So check those out to help determine who you want to vote for in the big NC Election.  If you're still not happy, then there are some new fan art pictures in the NC Gallery.  And if you're STILL not happy, then there are some new icons to download and a new background to look at in the Multimedia section.  Still not happy?  Well, too bad then.</UL><BR>

<UL><LI>Just an update to the NC Election.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/1/04<BR>
<UL><LI>After much hard work by myself, Romplayer, and many people at the NC Forum, the <A HREF="http://www.smbhq.com/nc/election/">Official NC Election 2004 site</A> is all step up and ready to go.  I think it looks pretty nice.  So check it out and take a look at all of the candidate that are running.  The Election page will be updated often (gasp!) over the course of the NC Election process, so check it out every so often.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/22/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Another new Short.  Special thanks to Metal Man from the SSQ for coming up with the idea of a Deathzooka.  And just so you know, we have finished selecting candidates for NC Election 2004.  You can see the final list of candidates on the NC Election page.  The primary election campaign has now started, so check out all of the new posters people are making for their candidates on the NC Forum.  The voting for the Primary Elections will probably take place some time in October/November.  For now, just go and read or take part in the campaign process.</UL><BR>

<UL><LI>NC Election 2004 is starting.  Please see the NC Forum for more details.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/6/04<BR>
<UL><LI>It's been a little quiet in here, mainly since I've had to deal with the transition into the new school year, like most of you, I bet.  So I've been having internet problems in my new apartment.  I should have it all worked out soon, though, I hope.  And I'm working on the next NC/SSS, which will be my next update.  Hope school is going well for all of you.  Oh yeah, Happy 7th Birthday to NC.  Another birthday can come and gone that I've missed out on doing something special for...oh well.  Maybe something cool will come to mind.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/25/04<BR>
<UL><LI>If you couldn't tell, I like Spy vs Spy.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/21/04<BR>
<UL><LI>New Short.  That's all.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/14/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Put up a whole bunch of Ask Dr. Donez questions that he answered from the NC Forum.  The topic is now closed, but Donez will try to start answering some more e-mail questions.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/14/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Again, I don't know what I'm thinking with these Shorts...heh.  Anyway, to my credit, the inspiration for this one came up in one of the chats I had with the people from the SSQ, who are always crazy fun.  So yeah...heh, go check out the SSQ.  I also finally updated the Ask Dr. Donez topic in the NC Forum so check that out too.  More updates...after I get some sleep.  Zzz.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/3/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Note to self - Stop making Shorts at 3am.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/30/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Three Shorts in one week, a new record!  Heh...</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/28/04<BR>
<UL><LI>I'm in a Short making mood, I guess.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/26/04<BR>
<UL><LI>New Short.  I don't know what I was thinking with this one.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/22/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Sean Kelly has the next episode of Lord of the Wings ready.  Enjoy!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/17/04<BR>
<UL><LI>New short.  Wee.  Next on my list - NC/SSS Mach 2 Part Whatever.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/7/04<BR>
<UL><LI>So I have Spy vs Spy on the brain.  Sue me.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/6/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Time I took to do my part of Lord of the Wings - About 6 Months.  Time it took Sean to do his part - About 3 Days.  Wow, I suck.  Anyway, the comix is great, so enjoy!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/3/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Yay, I finished my part of Lord of the Wings.  Now Sean can finally have the chance to do something...  Heh...</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/27/04<BR>
<UL><LI>The next part of the Lord of the Wings is indeed on it's way.  It shouldn't take me too long to make.  In the meantime, enjoy the new Short, which gives some special thanks to LVK for helping me come up with the idea.  Special thanks also goes to Mad Magazine, and their awesome Spy vs Spy cartoons.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/22/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Sean Kelly has made a quick update to the NC For Dummies page to include some of the recently introduced characters.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/18/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Found hiding on my computer were two old remakes that Lord Reid and Pat made.  So I put them up for you all to enjoy.  So...yeah.  Enjoy!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/15/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Against all odds...I give you the Lord of the Wings Part 2.  If it sucks, I will just blame the fact that I've spent the last two months finishing my college degree, heh.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/3/04<BR>
<UL><LI>I'm a college graduate now.  Yay me.  In case you were wondering, that's what I've been doing all of the last, well, four years.  Must....... finish...... next episode of LotW........ Bah.  Well, new Short for now.  Rumors of a possible NC Election for 2004 lingers in the NC Message Board.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/14/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Woo!  New section started up by Sean Kelly, called Q*Bert & Doppler at the movies.  Go check it out.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/14/04<BR>
<UL><LI>New short.  Because I say so.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/4/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Woo, sprite sheets!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/3/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow, talk about busy.  Well, there is a new Short up.  The idea for this short was inspired by Chompmaster from the NC Forum.  My next project plan is to do the Lord of the Wings Part 2, so I hope to get that done sometime this century.  Hope everyone is doing well in school.  I know I am...heh.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 4/19/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Now - Short!  Soon - Lord of the Wings!  Later - Who Knows?</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 4/2/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Heh.  Well, I didn't expect for many of you to fall for the "NC has been shut down by VGF" joke.  However, I also didn't expect for many of you to actually believe that the NC Deathmatch #19 I put up was a real one.  In fact, I made this NC Deathmatch #19 to also be an April Fools Joke.  If you notice, the Deathmatch is a little more stupid then normal.  Anyway, since no one really seemed to notice, maybe I won't have to do a "real" Deathmatch #19.  But I may.  Just because I feel like it.  Anyway, hope you all had a good April Fools!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/21/04<BR>
<UL><LI>I hope this new short will get you geared up for a new deathmatch...</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/12/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow...it's almost like I've reached a whole new level of being busy...  I guess your final semester as an Undergraduate will do that do you.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/2/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all.  Just when you thought there would be no new comix for a while......here's a new comix!  Yep, Lord Reid has finished the newest episode in the NC/SSS Mach 2 Crossover.  So take a look.  Hopefully I'll have my own comix done...well...sometime.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/1/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Still busy with school.  But I love to make these NC Shorts when I have free time.  So I hope you enjoy this one.  I had the idea for it yesterday, on the 29th, but I didn't have time to finish it.  Heh.  It may be a little strange.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/22/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Been pretty busy with school.  But I had an idea for an NC Short, so I spent some free time on that.  So I hope you enjoy.  My next goal will either be to work on Lord of the Wings Part 2 or NC Deathmatch #19.  I can't say when I'll have the free time to seriously work on them, though.  One must always hope.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/14/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all, happy V-day.  Hope you like the new NC Short.  I don't think Fred liked it, though.  Anyway, the new thing for today is an updated version of the NC Personality Test!  5 more questions and 6 new characters!  Plus the whole thing has been somewhat revamped.  So give it a try and see what NC Character you get.  It's not perfect yet, so I'll probably keep playing with it.  If you have any comments on things I should change to the NC Test, let me know.  Thanks and enjoy!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/30/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Part 1 of the new Lord of the Wings series is up, made by Sean Kelly.  Enjoy!  Part 2 will be made by me.  Look for it...well, either before or after NC Deathmatch #19.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/29/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all.  Well, it wasn't long, but it looks like I've started a new comix series.  This one will be based off of the popular NC Short that I made last year, called the Lord of the Wings, which was a parody of the Lord of the Rings.  The person aiding me for this comic series will be Sean Kelly, the guy who contributes many things to SMBHQ including the Mysteries section, the Mailbag, the Chatroom, and other stuff.  So it should be a lot of fun.  The first part of the series, the Prologue, is up now for you to take a look at.  We'll rotate back and forth like other comics series.  I think this one should be great, so I hope you all enjoy.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/26/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey NCers.  I did a lot of cleaning up today.  Put up a lot of stuff that needed to be put up.  Cleaned up the rest.  But the new stuff includes an updated Links page, the rest of the new Create-a-Characters that I have, and all of the Fan Art that I have.  The Fan Art goes in the NC Gallery, if you didn't know.  Also, those are the last Create-a-Characters that I have.  I now have no more Viewer Bios or Create-a-Characters or Fan Art to put up.  If you have some of any of those things that you'd like to put up on NC, please, feel free to e-mail me.  You may see some other changes around here as I clean things up.  I plan to start Deathmatch #19 soon.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/24/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Up today are a new batch of Ask Dr. Donez questions!  Send in your questions to the smart bird and he'll try to answer them.  He has no choice.  Maybe another update today?  Only time will tell.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/19/04<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all.  Hope you have been enjoying the NC Shorts.  Today I have updated the NC For Dummies Page and I have put up a couple new Top 10 Lists.  Look for Deathmatch #19 soon, which will feature Zadok VS Birdo VS Geno.  Should be a lot of fun.  Hope you're all enjoying the winter.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/19/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow.  Talk about school work.  Well, thanks for hanging in there.  I bet you've all been busy learning in school too.  Well, as amazing as it may seem, I have ACTUALLY finished NC/SSS Part 6.  I mean wow.  I even shocked myself.  Now...let's see where this series goes from here.  More over winter break.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 11/13/03<BR>
<UL><LI>The final episode of Mario Busters is up!  Also, please take take part in the Fan Comic Contest we're having in the Fan Comix Forum, for the month of November.  Submit your best comix and people vote on their favorite.  You can find it here <A HREF="http://www.vgf.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=71;t=000037">Fan Comic Contest</A>.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/31/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Happy Halloween!  What are you reading this for? Go get some candy.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/14/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all, a bunch of overdue Top 10 Lists are up, from people in the NC Forum.  Also, the SMBHQ/NC Chatroom is back.  Finally, check out the NEW Fan Comix Forum over at VGF!  This new compliment to the NC Forum is for all of your Viewer Comix Posting Needs.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/25/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Well, more problems happened this month.  Heh.  Things just arn't easy, anymore, are they?  First, more computer problems.  And second, Isabel hit, knocking out my power for three days.  The good news is that both of these problems are now dealt with and over.  So things should be good now, I hope, heh.  Anyway, I've only gotten about half of the people from NC Live to e-mail me.  If you're on that list, give me an e-mail soon, or I'll just have to pick someone else.  Also, I really, really, want to do something for NC's 6th birthday, so don't think I forgot.  If you have any ideas for what I should do, feel free to let me know.  Until then, later.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/7/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Bah!  I always seem to be busy on the birthdays.  Well, NC's 6th birthday was yesterday, for those who cared.  I'll probably put up something this week if I can to celebrate.  If you want to congratulate me with a small note, that would be cool too, heh.  Thanks all for 6 great years and counting!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/2/03<BR>
<UL><LI>And you thought NC Live would never finish.  Well, I got some help from Curt, and we've finally picked our first choices for NC Live.  Hopefully, it'll be easy to just get everyone to say their lines, then make this thing happen.  So go check out the page if you auditioned.  I just want to say now that ALL of the auditions were outstanding.  It was hard to choose.  Also, it is a large possibility that someone may pass or not want to do a part they were given.  If this happens, we'll need people to fill in as back ups.  So if you didn't get a part, please, don't feel bad.  You can get a second chance. Also, due to my computer being reformated, I LOST all of the e-mails of everyone who auditioned.  So you'll have to e-mail me if your name is listed.  I'm sorry, this isn't the best way to do this and not the way I would have liked.  I would have liked to personally e-mail everyone who auditioned.  But since I lost all of your e-mails, this is the best I can do.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/25/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Yo.  Just finishing up some summer work.  The SMBHQ server still isn't up 100%, but I can still update NC.  Look for some stuff around here over the next week.  I'll be sure to put something new up, even if it's just a new NC Short.  Anyway, for today, I archived the latest Ask Dr. Donez questions, from the NC Forum.  If you want Dr. Donez to answer your question in a hurry, go there and ask.  Dr. Donez will be sure to answer e-mail questions soon.  He's a busy bird.  Soon - Top Tens (I'm way overdue) and NC/SSS Mach 2 Part 6.  Hope you're all enjoying your summer!  And NC's 6th Birthday is coming up!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/11/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all.  In case you noticed anything strange around here the last week, it was because of the recent server move by VGF.  But things should be good now.  I fixed the Message Board link.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/31/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Defying all odds, I have finally finished Mario Busters Part 16.  Woo hoo.  I hope you enjoy.  Please note, it's been a little while since the last big comix I did, so I may be a little rusty.  But since I'm warmed up right now, count on a new big comix much quicker.  Also, I may not have good news for the NC Live, I may have to just cancel the entire idea.  More details soon.  Oh, and I hope to put up a whole bunch of overdue Top 10 Lists up soon.  Or at least get a little caught up.  Thanks for reading.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/2/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey.  Back from my trip.  Look for a big update soon AKA a big comix.  Probably the last Mario Busters.  And hopefully NC Live too.  Bug me to update if you want, it would probably help motivate me.  Enjoy the NC Shorts in the mean time.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/19/03<BR>
<UL><LI>New short.  Real update before the end of the week, I hope.  Will be gone all next week on vacation.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/14/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Thanks to Sean Kelly at SMBHQ, I think we have a chatroom again.  The new NC Chatroom will be a part of the SMBHQ Chat Network.  Over the next couple of days we'll see if we can get some chatting started.  So click the link and go over to the SMBHQ Chat Network and check it out.  Hopefully this new chatroom will work out.  If not, it'll be back to the drawing board.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/9/03<BR>
<UL><LI>A comix this week (I hope) plus the NC Live! finals.  I hope.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/3/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Finally free to update.  Let's see what I can do.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/23/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Yo.  I put up a new NC Short.  Let me know if you like those are not.  They're meant to be quick bits of humor, nothing much.  Also, I'll be putting up a page with the list of NC Live winners soon.  There will probably be a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice for each part, so don't feel bad if you didn't get the part you wanted.  If someone drops out, then you could have a chance.  Those should go up today, I hope.  More soon.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/21/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all!  Sorry for the short "vacation" I had there.  But there were a couple problems.  First, I had to finish the school year.  And second, my computer blew up and I had to reformat it.  But now school is over and my computer is back online, so I can start updating once again!  I don't have much for you right now, but expect some stuff over the next couple of days.  Mainly a new comix, some Ask Dr. Donez questions, Top 10 Lists, and more importantly, I'll finish the NC Live! auditions.  So for now, let me know what you think about the crazy new layout I made for NC.  Thanks!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 4/11/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Hi.  Just letting you know that the NC Live! auditions are going well.  I've recieved auditions from 13 people so far.  I've also extended the deadline to April 23, 2003, to give everyone a little more time.  So if you still want to send in an audition, you still have time.  Thanks.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 4/2/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Heh.  Hi.  For all of you who saw the note yesterday about NC being hacked into, April Fools.  Sorry, but it was all in good fun.  But the good news is that NC isn't dead.  So don't worry.  Anyway, if you didn't get a chance to see the OTHER joke I made, <A HREF="ffr.html">Fred Fred Revolution</A>, you can still do so.  I'll probably put it up on the index page soon.  Anyway, thanks a lot for bearing with me during April Fools.  I hope you enjoyed Fred Fred Revolution.  Long Live NC!  Oh, And I put up an old April Fool's joke classic, the <A HREF="fmario.html">Mario Worship Page<A>.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/24/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey there.  Mario Busters Part 15 is up, by CodieKitty!  Woo hoo!  Hope you enjoy.  I also tweeked the Choose Your Own Adventure, to make it more user friendly.  Make sure you send in your NC Live auditions if you want to participate.  Oh, and I was bored, so I put up some more Ask Dr. Donez! questions.  Send in your questions to the doc.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/8/03<BR>
<UL><LI>New section!  NC Live is here!  While it's not really very live, it should be a lot of fun.  All you need is a microphone and a voicebox.  So if you're interested in trying out for a part in the comix, just take a look at the page and send me an e-mail.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/2/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Woah there.  Well, that was a nice little break.  But I have a good reason why I havn't been able to update for a while.  I've been working on the NC Choose Your Own Adventure in Flash!  And it's done now!  Woo hoo!  So go check it out.  I hope you have luck downloading it, since it's kinda large.  If multiple people have problems with the size, then I will work on making a smaller version.  But until then, I have two versions of the CYOA up, one that's 220K and the other that's 160K.  Good luck and have fun!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/30/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Stupid server.  And stupid school.  Well, we have something up today which you should all enjoy, the 5th Part of the NC/SSS Crossover by Lord Reid.  What are you even here reading this for, anyway?</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/14/03<BR>
<UL><LI>Happy New Year!  Er, a few days later...  Heh...heh...  Anyway, thanks for hanging in there while I enjoyed Winter Break and started my winter semester of school.  I hope you all had a good holiday.  Anyway, there is some cleaning up stuff around NC.  Basically a bunch of little stuff.  First off, be sure to check out the sweet looking hand drawn Bill and Fred comic by Brian of NC Gallery fame.  Also, there is some new pictures in the NC Gallery from Link and other people.  Next, there are some cool NC Icons up in the Multimedia page brought to you by Space Yoshi X.  Also, I have put up some much-outdated Top 10 Lists (I'm caught up now!  Woo hoo!)  And finally, some Create-a-Characters are up so that you all don't kill me.  Enjoy!  Next - I hope to do the (not so) traditional NC Christmas Comix (which is now a little late) as well as the next part in the NC Chronicles.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/21/02<BR>
<UL><LI>I just updated the NC Guide for Dummies to include the more recent characters.  Also, I'll probably be away from my computer for the next week, so there will probably not be any updates.  I still plan to do my annual Christmas Comix, but it probably won't be finished until after Christmas.  I hope you all have a good holiday.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/6/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Finally!  Thank goodness!  A new comix by Jay!  NC Chronicles Part 4 is up!  Sorry for the delay, but school was beating me down for the entire month of November.  So enjoy the comix.  Next - Top 10 Lists and Mario Busters Part 14.  Oh, and due to confusion, the NC Chatroom is in limbo right now.  I'll let you know when we have something official up.</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 11/25/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all.  The NC Chatroom is back.  Sort of.  Heh.  Anyway, I was having a problem setting up the Java Script version of the chat, so you'll have to use mIRC for now on.  It's a simple program you can download for free from http://www.mirc.com.  Then all you have to do is join the #nc chatroom.  If you're still confused, go to the Chatroom page and Kamek from the VGF Forums explains it better.  I'll see you all in the NC Chatroom!</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 11/14/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Yawn.  So...busy...  Well, to show that I'm still alive and kicking, I added some overdue additions to the NC Gallery.  Plus, I put up a new Backround in the Multimedia section that was made by LVK.  Enjoy!  Next on my "to do" list - Mario Busters Part 14 and NCC Part 4.  Also be sure to check out the pictures taken of Fred from the new Kirby Cartoon show.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 11/2/02<BR>
<UL><LI>I just wanted to thank you all for voting for NC throughout the month of October.  We were able to end up at 6th place, I believe.  Great job!  We rule!  Like I promised, I'm going to continue to make the NC Chonicles until I feel that there isn't anything more to say about the past histories of the NC Gang.  Also, there is a progress bar up for NC/SSS Part 5, which is being made by Lord Reid.  10% doesn't sound like much, but at least we know he's alive and it is a start.  Soon I hope to put up another NC Chronicles and the next(last?) Mario Busters.</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 10/31/02<BR>

<P>
Neglected Character News for 10/13/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey there NC Fans.  The NC Forum has voted that the Special Treat for NC will be a Backround Comix.  This Comix will feature the early lives of all of your favorite NC Crew members.  At first, I was just going to do this comix all at once and release one HUGE Backround Comix.  But instead I decided to break it up and release each part by itself.  Thus making it easier for myself and giving you guys more updates.  So enjoy the first part of the NC Chronicles!</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 10/11/02<BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/7/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all.  Sorry for the lack of updates but I've just been pretty busy with school work.  But I just wanted to say that NC had a record high of 1000 hits last Sunday!  Wow!  Thanks all, for enjoying this goofy site so much to keep coming back.  I hope to have more soon.  So be on the look out.</UL><BR>

<A NAME="GOAL">Neglected Character News for 10/1/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Sweet.  NC is doing awesome in the Top Web Comics.  As I promised, I'll try to work on something special for you guys.  But let's now make the goal to STAY in the Top 10.  If we can do that all month, then that would really be special.  Lets do it!</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 9/30/02<BR>
<UL><LI>THE GREAT NC GOAL of OCTOBER 2002!  Join in!  For a while now, NC has been a member of the Top Web Comics.  This is a simple voting system to rank the Top 150 web comics.  It starts up every month with new voting.  So, I figured for the month of October, we should rally everyone at NC to vote for NC every day.  If every person at NC votes once every day for NC, then maybe, just maybe, we could get into the Top 10.  And that would be pretty dang cool.  So here's the deal.  If we can get into the Top 10 at the Top Web Comix, then I will promise to do something special at NC.  I don't know what yet.  Maybe I can have everyone at the NC Forum pick what they want the special treat to be.  So what do you say?  Try to vote for NC every day in the month of October and let's see how we do!</UL><BR>

<P>
Neglected Character News for 9/21/02<BR>
<UL><LI>Here's a late update that I should have put up weeks ago.  Remember NC's 5th Birthday?  Well, this new comix was sent in by Link at <A HREF="http://gmaster.topcities.com/">Game Master</A> for the occation.  I would have had it up on the Birthday, but was set back due to my busyness and VGF's downages.  So here it is now, so I hope you all enjoy.</UL><BR>

<UL><LI>Well, NC's Birthday was yesterday.  5 years on the internet and VGF had to be down.  Oh well.  Well, I was planning to have a HUGE update yesterday, but instead we'll have to settle for a smaller update today.  Up right now is a new NC for the NC list, Professor E. Gadd!  Also I have a whole bunch of new Fan Art up in the NC Gallery.  More to come soon.</UL><BR>

<P>
Neglected Character News for 7/9/02<BR>
<UL><LI>I don't know how official this will be, but I decided to announce it anyway.  It looks like NC Comix will now have a mirror address.  I did this for as number of reasons, with the main one being the unreliable VGF server.  SMBHQ will stay with VGF for as long as it holds out, but I thought it would be best to have an alternate location for the most popular section of NC, the Comix.  So if you bookmark it, you can be assured that it will be there all the time (I hope), even when the VGF server is down.  So check it out at this address.  <A HREF="http://nccomix.keenspace.com/">http://nccomix.keenspace.com</A>.</UL><BR>

<UL><LI>Updating as been a bit slow recently with all of my school work.  The main thing holding me down is all of the stuff in SMBHQ that I have to fix.  But I'll be updating quite a bit today.  Right now, I've removed the links to the Sprite Contest and the Luigi's Mansion Coverage, since it seems like Spencer doesn't want to reupload them.  Only half of the Viewer Comix are up, I have yet to hear from Carter for when the rest of them will get up.  I also updated for you the NC Gallery, the Award Gallery, and Brian's Gallery!

<UL><LI>AHA! Though I was dead, did you? Well, it just so happens that I was. Long story, but that doesn't matter. I uploaded a whopping ONE Viewer Comic. I have more on my computer, but I'll get to those later. Or not. Whichever I want. Anyway, this new comic is a very confusing one by the sorceror. Not just <i>a</i> sorceror, but <i>the</i> sorceror. There's too many sorceors these days, you know. They're sprouting like weeds.<br>~Carter</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/7/02<BR>
<UL><LI>OK, it's been a while since I've been able to update, but I've been pretty busy at home.  Today, however, I decided to clean up all of the stuff that needed to be cleaned up here at NC.  It's a big list.  First, I put up all of the Create-a-Characters that I have on my computer.  Thats all of them.  Unless you sent it recently, in which case it is probably in my mailbox.  If your Create-a-Character did not get put up, please send it again.  Then, I put up all of the Viewer Bios I have, which is all of them too.  Next, I made the January Top 10 List.  Next, I put up Part 4 of How To Make Your Own Comix.  Part 4 is short, but expect me to continue it soon.  Also, I added all of the links that needed to be added to the links list.  Finally, I finished up Bill the Extra Guy's Bio!  I hope you're all having a good new year.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/26/01<BR>
<UL><LI>NC is back, baby!  I am really getting tired of saying that.  That's why I'm looking around for some other server to host NC...anyway, I'm here at SMBHQ and VGF for now and I'll probably be here to say for a while if there is a God who is mercyful.  It's been one hell of a month though...during that time NC missed it's 4th birthday on September 6th...  Oh well.  Well, I'm now entering my 5th year of being on the internet, so I hope it's a good one.  Anyway, my job is to clean up a bit now and see what has to be done.  I extended the deadline to the NC Election 2000 till October 13th, so please vote if you havn't already done so.</UL><BR>

<P>
Neglected Character News for 8/13/01<BR>
<UL><LI>Has Jay gone crazy?  No, well, maybe yes.  Anyway, since I don't know how long I'll have access to the server, I figured I would update as much as I can right now.  I have for you today another new section, run by another new "staff" member.  It's the NC Sprite Contest, run by Spencer.  Now, I've been talking to Spencer and Carter for some time now, and they are the only two "staff" members that I am "hiring" at the moment.  Please don't send me your resumes.  If I need help, then I'll ask for help.  Also updated is Brain's Gallery and the rest of the NC Gallery.</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 8/12/01<BR>

<P>
Neglected Character News for 8/12/01<BR>
<UL><LI>I can update!  Woo hoo!  In celebration, check out the new comix series, the NC/SSS Crossover Comix.  VGF is suppose to move again, so I hope this problem of me with the server won't happen again.  If it does, I hope it doesn't last long.  And if it lasts long, then I hope you'll bear with me again.  But until then, I'll be an updating fool!</UL><BR>
<P>
Neglected Character News for 8/7/01<BR>
<UL><LI>OK, there has been a major lack of updates around here and I just wanted to let you all know that it isn't my fault.  Remember what happened back in Feburary?  The same thing happened again.  I don't even have access to the server yet, Kyle has been nice enough to update this for me.  So I just wanted to let you all know that I am in deed alive.  So heres the July list for you.  Plus, I've started the NC Election, so send in your final votes.  When I can finally update, which will hopefully be soon, expect a lot of stuff.  I have two new sections planned for the site, the start of the NC/SSS crossover, more Ask. Dr. Donez questions, Create-a-Characters, and more.  So stay tooned to NC!  Thanks.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/1/01<BR>
<UL><LI>NC is back, baby!  Now, i bet most of you are asking, what the hell happened to NC?  Basically, the answer is very simple.  Something happened with the server, and it ate NC for about a month.  This did two things.  First, it deleted my January update and second is threw me out of the server, making it impossible for me to update.  Don't ask me how, i don't know.  But what i do know is that i am able to update again!  woo hoo!  also, please note the new adress for NC.  OK, i'm sorry i don't have anything new for you today, all i was able to do at this short notice was throw up the stuff that got deleted.  As a note the NC Election Primary deadline has been moved to March 21, 2001 due to the server problem.  I hope to get an update tomarrow, so see you then!</UL><BR>

Soon to come-Stuff!</UL><BR>
<P>
