cloud when he saw a pipe.He wondered where the pipe  went to so he flew down<BR>
the  pipe.Upon landing he saw people with mushrooms on their heads.He was in<BR>
the Mushroom Kingdom.He said hello to a man  who screamed and ran off.He<BR>
tried to make some friends but all anyone did upon setting eyes on him was<BR>
scream and run off.Lakiut found another pipe and went in it. It took him to<BR>
Bowser's Castle.He told Bowser he needed a job; so Bowser gave him a job of<BR>
doing evil things to Mario.At this time most Lakiuts are evil but a few are<BR>
good.<BR>
