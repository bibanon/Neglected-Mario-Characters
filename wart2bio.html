	Well, where I last left off, Bowser was getting his butt kicked by Mario.  Wart, with the other half of Bowser’s force, never got to the Mushroom Kingdom in time to prevent the Mario Bros from defeating Bowser.  Wart had to make a decision, he could attack the Mushroom Kingdom full force in hope to rescue the captured Bowser, or he could lay low and wait for further orders from Bowser.  He decided to lay low, and a month later, with no word from Bowser, he gave up hope and moved on with his life.  He gathered his part of the Koopa Troop and took them to the far off island Subconia.  There he set up his own government, waiting to build his army until the right moment, when he could attack the Mushroom Kingdom, and proclaim it for the name of Bowser.  A year later, Bowser showed up on the island, exiled from the Mushroom Kingdom.  He was overjoyed to see Wart with his army, and Wart was overjoyed to see Bowser, his King.  After a long meeting, Bowser decided to attack the mushroom kingdom right away by surprise.  Wart told Bowser of the system of moving from one place to another quickly called the Sub-Con.  A person could enter Sub-Con, which was not part of the waking world, and travel great distances.  So Bowser gathered his army, and had his accident (see the Koopa Kid’s Bio) which disabled him from continuing command.  After this he made the decision to send Wart though the Sub-Con with the army.  Wart promised not to fail him, and stepped though the door, with his Shys and Beezos.  The trip was longer then expected.  But there was lots of food in Sub-Con.  But for some strange reason, the Mario Bros. showed up!  Wart was taken by surprise.  He scattered his army, and took defensive positions across Sub-Con, to ambush the Plumbers.  But it was no use!  The Mario’s didn’t seem to know what was going on, they did not know of Bowser’s Plan, but they did know something was wrong, so they fought all the way to Wart, and by using his weakness against him, they defeated him with veggies.  Wart was never heard off again.  When the door to Sub-Con Closed forever, Wart was caught inside.  The End<BR>
	One more note-This is why I believe he has a cameo in Link’s Awakening “sort of.”  You see, both Super Mario Bros 2 and Link awakening involve a “Dream World.”  Apparently Wart is a part of both dreams, or the dreams are connected some how.  We may see Wart again...
