Question 76: Can you teach me Fred's Ray of Death/Death Ray/Deathly Death Ray of Deathly Deathliness attacks? I already learned Bill's through the Discovery Channel, now I need Fred's collection. Then I will conquer Japan and force them to make NC games as well as normal games forever!!! MWAH HAH HAH!!! But to do so, I need Fred's attacks. Please? You'll get your own game, "Dr. Donez Takes Over the World in Stereo with the Help of Bill and Fred and Together They Kill Clinton, Bush, Bush, and Gore!" With the ridiculous price we stamp on it and the commercials we use to poison peoples' minds and force them to buy it, you'll have more money tan Bill Gates after the royalties off the first game alone. <BR>
