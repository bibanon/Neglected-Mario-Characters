Question 1: Why doesn't Link or all the people in the Zelda world have a last name but Mario and Luigi do?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, you see, its all because Nintendo is dumb.  Plus the only place where the Mario Bros. actually have a last name is in the stupid movie, so I wouldn't even count that.  Maybe Link doesn't have a last name.<BR><BR>

Question 2: Who do you think looks prettier, Daisy or Peach?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Hey, I'm a tweeter!  Human's aren't my taste.<BR><BR>

Question 3: Why is your weapon an Ice Pick?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Because it rules!  I mean, come on, who wouldn't want to use an Ice Pick for a weapon???  Anyone?  Ah, nevermind.<BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: Yesterday.<BR><BR>

Question 10: Why can't animals talk?<BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: Yesterday.  They came with the aliens.<BR><BR>

Question 15: Why is the third hand on a clock called the second hand?<BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: 'Cause not all your dogs are barking?<BR><BR>

Question 17: Why do I ask so many questions?<BR>

Question 18: Why is it when someone says your name it goes to a close up of you?<BR>
