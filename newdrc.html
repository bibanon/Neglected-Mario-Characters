<B>Created By:</B>  o0Fireball0o<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Dr.Cortez<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Male<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Sub-Con<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Any enemies of Dr.Donez. Except Mario...<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Mario, and all friends of Dr.Donez.<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  EVIL!<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Dr.Cortez is a tweeter. He has glasses, and wears a lab coat with purple rubber lab gloves.
....but tweeters don't even have fingers though, do they? So who knows how he can wear lab gloves, but...<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Dr.Cortez is sort of absent minded at times. He hates Dr.Donez, and the reason behind that is because Dr.Donez burnt down his house years ago because he didn't get the part of the first tweeter in SMB2, and Dr.Cortez did. Since then Dr.Cortez has gotten...kind of...well insane, and wants to get his revenge by destroying Dr.Donez. He really liked that house that Dr.Donez brunt down...
He also went to B.U.M school with Donez and Fred.
Dr.Cortez doesn't like Mario since Mario threw vegetables at him, jumped on him, and threw him at other shyguys or tweeters. He also wants to get revenge on Mario, but not as much as he wants to get revenge on Dr.Donez.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Super Mario Bros. 2, SM64, Paper Mario, just about any other Mario game. Except he wasn't. Only SMB2 and Mario Advanced.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Making plans on how to get rid of Dr.Donez and Mario, rule the world(by using a banana, banana bread and grapefruit extract. He'll steal that from Dr.Donez after he destroys him. At least that's what he plans to do.) and steal all the banana bread in the world. Oh, and he's also making plans on taking over NC, and to get his own close up like Dr.Donez has, instead of the camera always zooming FAR away from him when his name is said, or nothing just happening at all.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  What could Dr.Cortez be up to? Anything?<BR>
