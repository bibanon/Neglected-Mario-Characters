Definition: Goomba <goohm-bah> (n.)- A brownish squishy enemy that is found all over 
Mushroom Kingdom.  They are known for be squished on. Derived from greek goombik (squishy object) <BR>

The story starts when Kamek saw that Baby Bowser had potential of being 
very BAD person. So using his trusty wand, he made it rain eggs. (No yoshi 
was not in em') These eggs landed in Giant Land (SMB3) and they hatched. Inside were 
huge goombas.
They were mostly male except there was only one female and lucky for 
them mating
season was just around the corner. Anyways unfortunately the female 
Goomba died
because of "squishy" complications but fortunately there were now 
millions of little male
Goombas. <BR><BR>
	The Goombas were happy for several years in there kingdom but one day 
Kamek
snatched the little Goombas and took them to Bowsers castle where he 
trained them. He
needed enemies to make sure that Princess Peach would not be snatched by 
any unwanted
guests. Bowser was not stupid either, he knew these goombas were not 
going to be very
useful but he placed them all over the land to hopefully catch the hero 
off guard somehow. <BR><BR>
	Mario and Luigi had no trouble with the goombas during SMB and SMB3.
After both adventures, the Goomba population was decreasing fast so 
Kamek casted two 
spells. One was to make another female Goomba appear and voila another 
bazillion
goombas. But again she did not last long!. The other spell was to create 
a laboratory so
that Bowser could strengthen the Goombas. After Bowser took Peach 
(again) in SMW he
took a quarter of the Goombas and brought them to a lab in dinosaur Land 
and put the
other three quarter in a dungeon at Mushroom Kingdom. In the lab, he 
placed a hard shell
on the Goombas so they would not die if they got squished and he made 
them rollable.
This did make them somewhat stronger but they were still not much of a 
threat to Mario
and Luigi. <BR><BR>
	Bowser prepared to change the rest of the goombas to stronger enemies 
but he
soon found that his laboratory was gone! No one knows what happened to 
it. So he just
let them go to help him out (kinda) in SMRPG and SM64. <BR><BR>
	Meanwhile in Giant Land the big Goombas were almost extinct and it 
seemed like
a female Goomba would not appear. They knew they were in danger of being 
extinct so
they decided to search for a way out or something that would make them 
survive. They
found a pipe that took them to the Huge part of Tiny-Huge Island a la 
SM64 and they
were happy there until Mario crashed there party. <BR><BR>
	No one knows what happened to the Goombas after SM64. They may be
preparing for SM642 or maybe their race is extinct. Or perhaps  maybe 
Bowser was smart
enough to find a stronger enemy than Goombas... but I doubt that! No one 
will ever
know... for now! <BR><BR>
	Okay my Bio is done I just have one last thing to say....let's face it 
they are dumb
but Goombas are still cool! (???? -Kyle) One more thing if you ever see a Goomba do 
not piss them off
cause they can make the sky flash (In SMPRG)
