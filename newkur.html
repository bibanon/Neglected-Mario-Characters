<TITLE> Kuribo </TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Kuribo </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  JMycroft<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Kuribo, Guardian of Refuge Island<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Male<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Refuge Island (Now Marioland)<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Vittorio, Genarro, Petunia, Jugem, Young Mario, Luigi, Peach and Daisy.  Pet-A gigantic raccoon named Tanooki<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Kamek<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Good<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  A huge, wind-up mechanical giant.  Has a long, wise face (strangely like Abe Lincoln, I'm told by people 	who have seen my illustrations), bushy eyebrows, and long, curled black beard.  Wears a large 	green majestic robe, tall, pointy green hat and big green boots, with large keys in the heels.  The keys are 	used to wind him up.  Long mechanical limbs.  Powerful but gentle appearance and manner.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Was created by the wizard Jugem to protect Refuge Island, and it's inhabitants.  Fights against intruders.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  His footwear appear in SMB3.  Could also appear in:  Super Mario Parents.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Hard to say.  Last seen with Genarro and Petunia (also missing) several decades ago.  No trace of him
	on Refuge Island, now known as Marioland.  Of course, we have all seen his precious footwear being
	used as playthings by Goombas...  Hope he's all right...<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Though big and fearsome, he's actually quite gentle and hates violence.  He mostly relied on his
	appearance to scare away enemies.  The exception is Kamek.  I know someone has already done
	Kuribo, by the way, but this is him as he appears in my fan-fic.<BR>
