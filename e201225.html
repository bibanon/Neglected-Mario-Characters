<H2><CENTER>Ask Dr. Donez! </H2></CENTER><BR><BR>

Question 201: Why do you think Mario is so dumb? He told me he liked Dr. Donez, he thinks your "cool". I thought Mario was cool all my life, I grew up with him hes the bomb! (So are you) Oh and wheres my fish taco?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Sigh, stupid Mario.  I wish he would just leave me alone.  Do you know how hard it is to work in your lab when an idiot is bothering you all the time?  And I ate your taco.  It was yummy.<BR><BR>

Question 202: Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: She's currently selling stock in Mongolia.<BR><BR>

Question 203: Dr. D, I think we need a little talk. You have, like, a billion VGF questions, but only 200 E-mail questions. What's with that? Are the questions sent to u by e-mail not good enough for u?? Huh? Are the questions I sent NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU????!!! HUUUHHHHHH?????!!!!!!! ANSWER ME YOU #$%$^^% #$%$%%%ing bird!!!!!!!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, I believe the answer to your question is simply that it is much easier to answer questions at VGF, where the Ask Dr. Donez idea was started, then to answer e-mail questions.  Plus, e-mail smells funny,<BR><BR>

Question 204: Will a duck eat the door (my sister told me to ask you this, so don't blame me)? What about a horse?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, if the duck is really hungry, or thought that the door was a apple pie, then it would eat it.  A horse is a little smarter.<BR><BR>

Question 205: Stupid ketchup! Sorry, my sister said that too. Is she an idiot or what?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Be nice to your sister.  That's an order.<BR><BR>

Question 206: Why was the above text in caps lock? Does the Elec. Pick have power equal to the Fire pick?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: The current powers of the Fire Pick and the Elec Pick are unknown.  But they can't possibly be as cool as the Ice Pick (pun intended).<BR><BR>

Question 207: Hey Dr. Donez, when you take over the world, can you stop the commercials from freezing the music all the time? It's so annoying! And on Ally McBeal, make it so whenever the "record-scratching sound" plays, it'll be an everlasting loop that gets on your nerves and lasts the entire scene. It'll truly be more funnier, as it gets on the characters' nerves as well. They'll even say things like, "What did I do to deserve this job?" How's that for a question?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: (Shudder)  I'll try my best.<BR><BR>

Question 208: If You Are A Bird And A Plane Leaves Albuquerque,New Mexico at 4:27 FM anda train leaves Minnesota traveling 427 MPD(Miles per Decade)when will the toast be done?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I was done 5 minutes ago.  Where were you?  I already ate my half.  It tastes good with grape jam.<BR><BR>

Question 209: Why doesn't anyone just give some stupid taco to that chihuahua dude?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Because then Taco Bell wouldn't make any $$$.<BR><BR>

Question 210: Hey Dr. D, how'd you get to be so cool!?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I invented a "cool" machine that makes my "cool" level much higher then normal mortals.  Plus, I own an Ice Pick.  See previous pun.<BR><BR>

Question 211: Dr.donez, do you enjoy working with mario, bill, and fred, or does it bug you?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Bill is a great guy, Fred is a bit pushy sometimes, and Mario is just downright a pain.  I'm just glad he sticks to SMBHQ most of the time.<BR><BR>

Question 212: Hi i was just wondering docter donez are there any cheats for mario rpg and also Toad rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(ok i said it can i have my 20 bucks now toad????) well thanks for listening bye<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: If you press "A" then "B" then reset your SNES 50 times in a minute, then you'll get an extra level in your current game.<BR><BR>

Question 213: Who created the Ice Pick? (MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH::cough::cough::AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No one knows...  It's a mystery to all.  I think it may be an ancient relic from the BNC era (Before Neglected Characters).<BR><BR>

Question 214: How many plasma dischargers would it take too materialize a 40x80 piece of colorenite steel inside Jay Respo's fort, under 230x the gravity of Earth. when you find that number, multiply it by 20, divide it by 60, and put that number in an automatic calculator and set it for Max Whip. when you get the number, ad that number too how many pounds Mario is. how many ounces would that be?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...Well...look at the time, I have a train to catch.<BR><BR>

Question 215: Who would win Bill and Fred or Bill and Ted?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, Bill and Fred don't have the ability to travel through time, so I say Bill and Fred anyway.<BR><BR>

Question 216: Who Framed Roger Rabbit?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I did.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<BR><BR>

Question 217: Who are your parents?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um, Mr and Mrs. Donez.  Duh.<BR><BR>

Question 218: Do you believe in Santa Claus?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Only when he gives me presents.<BR><BR>

Question 219: What's my first name if it is the same as yours?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Dr.?  That's a stupid first name.<BR><BR>

Question 220: What does you ever think of rainbow colored bannana?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...yeah...moving on.<BR><BR>

Question 221: Did you know that humans are 52% bannana?  It's really true.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Being an expert on Banannas, I would have to say that you're insane.<BR><BR>

Question 222: Did you know that you have no brain because you've answered all these stupid questions?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, someone has to answer them.<BR><BR>

Question 223: Question: Why is there a couple blue spots on your wing on your closeup?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...what do I look like?  Go bother Jay.<BR><BR>

Question 224: If Jay tries to blow up the world again, can we blow him up?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: That's a great idea!  I like it.<BR><BR>

Question 225: How old will I have to be before I can breath fire like King Dad, and then roast the butthole who wrote question 180?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Beats me.  I'm not much of an expert on Koopa.<BR><BR>
