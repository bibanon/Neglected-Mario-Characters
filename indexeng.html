<CENTER>This is Alexander Witz and like many Nintendo fans, disapproves I all letters, which are neglected and arrive second charge metering at tubby, which admit only as Mario are. These letters are one like toad, Yoshi, Wario and princess. Even if they those are to store to the daily it is Mario, which receives the whole credit note. Each week or I communicate another neglected letter in such a way to repeat over and give them the praise, which they really earn. Well thats, which eichelhaeher Resop used, to do. But I bought the place of assembly of it. Now I am that, who sets above everyone wacky for material, which I can come with above, in order to give praise to the many neglected Mario letters. =) ** SPECIAL NOTE **, which I strongly work, in order to produce the tendency on this side. No the material on my side can be copied. Please you ask ME, Alexander Witz, before the theft of everything first, away from the side. If I find out the fact that you took somewhat trusts you me, I finds out, where you are and drives the Misten out from you. The InterNet is not large that. As another note can be copied, NO comix on this side for each possible reason without my agreement. Like a third note, Fred the Splinter Yard, the Clone Call, Compute You the Extra Chap, General Practitioner Donez, Are Zitrusfrucht Man and Prof. Executrain all names, which I caused and copyright by me am, since I permit-proved the place of assembly of the eichelhaeher Resop had bought. Those names and everything of the other prepared letters, which are used here on numerical control, cannot be used possibly without my agreement or the agreement of the creator of the letter. Thanks for your cooperation. Have a beautiful day. =)

<CENTER>Straight ones as note, I write these articles as Mario fan. Some of parts of my letter information comes from the Nintendo which are based on facts. The remainder is my own fantasy. None of this is writen, in order to discredit Nintendo. Enjoy.<BR>
<IMG SRC="churroe.gif"><BR>
The cost counter following was begun 1998 on July 1, when numerical control was given first eichelhaeher to Resops for total control. It gave many successes uncounted for for September to 6, 1997, when numerical control was introduced first to the SMBHQ. On April, control was brought to 1 2005 by numerical control by the eichelhaeher Resop on me, Alexander Witz. Special owing to Kyle Orland for annoying section of the standing eichelhaehers of its side for the last years and all fans, which have, contibuted. And SPECIAL extra thanks eichelhaeher Resop for selling its place of assembly to me. I am a VERY MUCH LARGE fan of numerical control. Like another note, everything sprites of the letters, which are used here, by their respective companies to be possessed (AKA Nintendo and Hal). I do not take credit note for causing these letters. Everything, which I did, is given it again, cooler names.<BR>
