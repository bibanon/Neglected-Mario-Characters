<H2><CENTER>Ask Dr. Donez! </H2></CENTER><BR><BR>

Question 501: If I stole the sword of excalibur from the tv show and replaced it with your ice pick, you would be unstopable with this magical powerful sword, you could even rule the wourld!  But would you be happy with my trade?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I really doubt that a thousand year old sword can be more powerful then the great Ice Pick.  It's probably all rusty and all.  Hasn't that sword been lying in a lake for centuries?  I'll pass.<BR><BR>

Question 502: So what do you say we become friends, I'll show my friendship with you by being your test dummie and slave, but you have to pay me 50 bucks an hour though, and i need a job too!  PS: Major fan of you!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: If you want to become one of Dr. Donez's official "friends", you must first fill out the thirty page application form, and then wait in line like everyone else.  Hey, just because you're my friend, doesn't mean you're special.<BR><BR>

Question 503: I AM THE EGGMAN! Anyway....... Do you like games with Sonic in them?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Those Sonicy games go too fast.  They make my little tweeter head hurt.<BR><BR>

Question 504: Dr. Donez (Jay) you really need to update.....I'M GOING CRAZY I really love 
your comix and I totaly agree that Luigi is been in that fat plumbers shadow 
too long.Well any way I'm sooooo inpatient that I even make my own comix 
while I'm waiting for an update they star most of the NC characters I even 
make my own version of some of your comix. Now to the question you think I 
could be one of the people that make the comics on NC?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, Jay's really quite an egotistical jerk when it comes to his website.  He's pretty particular about being the only person who works on it.  But go ahead and write your own comics.  And when you do, give me a better job.  And more lines.<BR><BR>

Question 505: Dear Dr.Donez if I mixed yoshi DNA with frog DNA then mixed it CFJ (cherry 
flavoured jell-o) then some N potion what would it make I think it would 
make a evil frog with a bottomless stomach and what if I added a Phantasy 
Star III cartridge or a Mario is Missing cartridge into the mix?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: We need someone in here to enforce the use of "periods".<BR><BR>

Question 506: Can Dr. Donez pick his nose, fart, and burp while singing "Who Let the Dogs Out?" all at the same time??<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: If I could, why on earth would I still be here?  With those kinds of skills, I could be president or something.<BR><BR>

Question 507: Do you have any brothers or sisters?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I don't know.  If I do, they sure don't like me enough to call.  Or acknowledge my existance.  Can't say I blame them.  Or maybe I should start reading all of those Christmas cards I get every year.  For some reason I always thought they were bills.<BR><BR>

Question 508: Hey Dr. Donez, are you the tweeter in the first Tryclyde's room of SMB2?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No, I'm the second tweeter in the first level of the game, if you must know.  Where have you been?<BR><BR>

Question 509: Hey Donez WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE IN NC/SSS MACH 2 PART 8 AGAIN!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...  Don't we have some sort of person screening these questions?  Oh wait, that's Jay's job.  Nevermind.  That explains it.<BR><BR>

Question 510: Why is cheese yellow if cows go moo?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: If you say moo really fast your face turns yellow.  Give it a try.<BR><BR>

Question 511: Hey, Dr. Donez...

DR. DONEZ! DR. DONEZ! DR. DONEZ! DR. DONEZ! DR. DONEZ! DR. DONEZ! DR. DONEZ!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Ow...  Stop that.  Don't make me, I donno, do something.  Yeah.  I'll do something.  That's it.  Ooooo.  Fear my empty threat at doing something!<BR><BR>

Question 512: Since nintendo is discrediting you, are you thinking about moving to S.C.E.A. (Sony Computer Entertainment America -- Playstation's company)<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: It's kinda hard to leave Nintendo, since they have me locked up and all.  At least the food isn't too bad.<BR><BR>

Question 513: Is king kong donkey kong's great great great great grandfather?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Yeah sure, whatever.  And if you say moo really fast, your face turns yellow.  Give it a try.<BR><BR>

Question 514: Do Zoo Pals make eating fun?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Why does eating have to be fun?  How about this - eat or you starve.<BR><BR>

Question 515: Is is possible to splice the DNA of a tweeter, a microwave pretzel, and a Mario?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No, it's against the law to do any chemical or genetic tests with Marios.  Too messy.<BR><BR>

Question 516: Why does Sam-I-Am constantly pester that guy to eat his green eggs and Ham? Ya know, if I was that guy I'd take his ham and cram it down the furry midgit's throat. And what's with the Cat in the Hat? Why did he go inside those kid's house without permission and trash up the place with Thing 1 and Thing 2? I swear, Dr. Suess had issues when he wrote that stuff. BTW, what do you use to gel your feathers?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Instant Jell-o pudding.<BR><BR>

Question 517: What  the heck is your problem?  If you ever kill Dr.Executrain will you start eating Toad?  I must kow you eco-weinee1<BR>

Question 518: Hey Doctor Donez, why doesn't your close up bit work on the Ask Doctor Donez questions?<BR>

Question 519: Where did you get the Ice Pick?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I think it was given to me as a lame birthday present from my aunt.  She didn't even have a receipt!<BR><BR>

Question 520: Could I have an ice pick?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well sure, if your aunt gives you one.<BR><BR>

Question 521: And if you have The One Ice Pick, can I have The Two Ice Pick?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: You've been watching too much fantasy.  Balance it with some sci-fi.  Doctor's orders.<BR><BR>

Question 522: Who is the smartest guy I should ask to do my maths homework
and the dumbest (apart from Mario)???<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Ahem.  You're looking at him.  I guess that could answer both questions, so I'll leave it at that.<BR><BR>

Question 523: Dr. Donez- Do you think Lemmy the Lemming should stop copying Lemmy "Hip" Koopa's name?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Hey, it's his name.  Lemmy doesn't go to your house and tell you to change your name.  And if he does, then well, I apologize.<BR><BR>

Question 524: Oh, hi, I just want you to know that Billy Bob wants his puppies back, and he says that if you don't give them back right now, he's going to use his army to blow up your muffin.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: That muffin is long gone now.  Hahaha.<BR><BR>

Question 525: Why does Jay like Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link so much? I thought it stunk.<BR>

Question 526: How many pecks of pickled peppers did Peter Piper pick?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Say cow really fast.<BR><BR>

Question 527: What exactly makes you different from any other Tweeters? Minus the fact that you're a doctor.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, besides the fact that I'm a doctor, I'm also the only tweeter that has the first three seasons of Cheers on DVD.<BR><BR>

Question 528: I have a question for you Dr. Donez what is your real name? Or is Dr. your real name?  The first question is the one I'm asking so it's not two questions.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I believe this question has already been answered.  Look through the previous 2000 questions to find it.<BR><BR>

Question 529: How come Team Rocket keeps popping up in my dreams all of a sudden?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Put down the Pokemon.  We're sending someone to help.  Everything will be OK.  Just stay on the line and don't go try to catch them all.<BR><BR>

Question 530: Why did my power go out all of a sudden?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: It might be because you're trying to play five million Gamecubes all at once.<BR><BR>

Question 531: Do you know what 7,779 divide by 787 if you don't you need to do math over!!! HA,HA!!!!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Was that a question?  I think I shall answer it with my own.  Why?  Because I can.<BR><BR>

Question 532: Exactly HOW MUCH money do you have, including French, Japanese, German, Chinese, Swedish, Brazilian, Madagascar, and Atlantian?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Not nearly enough, or I'd be so out of here.<BR><BR>

Question 533: Okay. This is a very long and complicated question but I'm sure you'll answer it. If you take a super mushroom and put it in a sock, what is the fraction equivalent of a super mushroom in the sock + cheese, and would this affect its smelliness? If so, then how hungry would the socks be? Multiply it by 257,000, then switch the pencil around and write it on the cheese so that the sock isn't hungry, and then find the square root of 39895 to make the cows laugh. How many minutes would they laugh? Divide this number by 5 and then shout Ya-hoo when you're done!<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Such a long and complicated question deserves and equally long and equally complicated answer.  But because I don't feel like it, I'll just say "2".<BR><BR>

with my problem, I'll give you some Super Cherry Flavored Jell-O Bombs to
