<CENTER> <H2> THE KOOPA KIDS</H2> </CENTER>
<H4> Morton, Lemmy, Iggi, Roy, Ludwig, Wendy O, and Larry </H4>

<B>Mario Games they've been in (with a major role in the story) </B> <BR>
The KK's have only been in few games so far.  Hopefully we will se more in the future! <BR>
<UL>
<LI> SMB:3-FIRST APPEARANCE!  This is what started it off.  After this they become accepted as great additions to the MARIO kingdom.  This game they kidnapped Mushroom kings and got kicked around by LUIGI (I'm ALWAYS the second player).
<LI> SMW-They came back for an second time.  This time they kidnap, uh, Yoshi eggs (those fiends!).
</UL>
<B>Mario Games they HAVEN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
Every single other Mario game <BR> <BR>

<B>Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
It's just info about the KK's and the cool stuff they've done that no oone has noticed <BR>
<UL>
<LI> One of the only NC's to appear in both the comics and the TV shows.
<LI> Wendy O Koopa Suit?  This obscure item in SMB:3 I don't even know is real, but I heard about it.  Anyway, we should thank Wendy O. for leaving it there.
<LI> That's about it (for more info why, see Bowser's Forgotten Heroism)
</UL>
<B>Why People Like Bowser's Kids: </B> <BR>
Why do people like Bowser's snotty bunch of kids? <BR>
<UL>
<LI> They can relate-Do you have a father demented on World Conquest?  Don't lie.
<LI> They're easy to beat-Let's face it, they're a bunch of wimps.
<LI> Pity-They always get beat up by MARIO 'cause they are related to Bowser. Well, I guess they were doing evil things too.
<LI> Mystery-Where did they come from???  How did Bowser have kids???  WHO IS MRS. KOOPA?????  The world may never know.
</UL>
