<B>Baby Bowser  By, Sleep Kirby</B><BR>
Weight: 1/3 of Bowser<BR>
Height:1/3 of Bowser<BR>
# of times they have been mistaken as the Koopa Kids: 1<BR><BR>

The story of the Baby Bowsers is a sad one. After their defeat in SMW, the Koopa Kids were sent all to Subcon to die. So Bowser, without any helpers, lost again and again, so finally, after SM64, he played with his DNA and made clones. But as all clones are, they were only 94% right, and sence the clone Machine was made by a Magikoopa, they were only 1/3 right. So Bowser, being the evil one he is, teached them to be evil and twisted, so when Mario got together with Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario and DK to settle who was the Super Star, they evetuelly got all of their stars stolen by Bowser, at his secret base. There he gave each of the Baby Bowsers a Star to defend, but like the Koopa Kids, they were wimps and Mario and his friends got them back and sent Bowser far away. The Baby Bowsers are now hiding in the Mushroom Kingdom, waiting for Bowser to lose again.<BR><BR>
<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
Hm...new characters are always odd.  But at least they are original.

 Bowser, after being beaten Twice on the same day, retreated to his
hideout in the
 sky. There, He took in Lots of star power. He then fused into a neon
bowser.
 His skin and shell glowed differant colors, and with the power of the
stars, he 
 could create shockwaves and destroy the platform. Soon, Mario found
Bowser in his
 Hideout. They fought BIG TIME!!!!!! However, Bowser, even in his Neon
form, couldn't
 beat Mario. so, he retreated. He then Lost his neon look, and became
less powerful.
 Bowser is currently coming up with a plan for SM642. ( We all know whats
coming. )<BR>

the sky?<BR><BR>

OK, I guess I have to play SM64 to get this one.
