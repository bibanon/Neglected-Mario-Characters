<TITLE> Princess Peach </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Princess Peach Toadstool</H2> </CENTER>

<B> Mario Games she's been in: </B> <BR>
These are the games where Peach has had an active role.  Like most neglected characters, it isn't much.
<UL>
<LI> SMB:2- Shared role with 'rest.  Pretty good jumper, but that's about it
<LI> SMK/SMK 64- Speedy driver, uh that's about it
<LI> SMRPG- GREAT healer, definitely the best character aside from Bowser
</UL>
<B> Mario Games she's had a major role in the story: </B> <BR>
WOW! I think I need a bigger computer to hold them all! <BR>
<UL>
<LI> SMB- Bowser took her, mushy ending with Mario for the ending.  Notice you see Luigi no where 
<LI> SMB:3- Bowser had his kids change all the kings into animals then takes her.  Peach is a bit 	humorous in the ending 
<LI> SMW- Again, Bowser takes her.  Helps Mario with mushrooms in the final battle 
<LI> SM 64- Same big hairy deal.  This time in 3-D, and with a cake! 
<LI> SML3:WL- A bunch of pirates took her statue. Who knows?!?! 
<LI> SMRPG- She wasn't a acting character for the ENTIRE game, so I put it in both.  She was in most of the story 
</UL>

<B> Mario Games she HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
Games where I guess they got tired of the Mario defeats Bowser/saves Peach deal.
<UL>
<LI> SMW:2- Before she was born (I assume)
<LI> SML- Replaced by princess "Daisy".  Where is SHE from?  Look out for a future cat fight! 
<LI> SML:2- I have absolutely no idea.  Maybe she got lost on the way to Mario land. 
</UL>
<B> Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
It's just info about Peach and reasons she has been neglected.
<UL>
<LI> Uh, she kicked butt in Sub-Con
<LI> Uh, well, she kicked butt in SMRPG
<LI> Without her mushrooms, Mario never would have defeated Bowser in SMW. Uh, yeah!
<LI> Um, that cake in SM64 was pretty nice  (BTW, the dolls on it are life size! If you've seen the ending, you'll understand what that means).
<LI> In Nintendo Power's Mario comics, Peach ends up saving them all!
<LI> Tolerates Mario's womanizing and promiscuity (erhrrm, Daisy, Pauline)
</UL>

<B> Why People Like Peach: </B> <BR>
Why people still trust the Princess even after being captures by Bowser time, after time, after time.
<UL>
<LI> Femininity- Is that a word?  But it's true, Girls need to look up to a hero that doesn't have body odor.
<LI> Royalty- Like Toad, she ranks high on the 'successful in life' scale.
<LI> Pity- Why is it that Bowser ALWAYS tries to get to Mario through Peach.  By now she should have a bag of clothes marked- "In case of Bowser."
<LI> Crown- Shiny.  Like Indiana Jones, that gold hat never seems to come off.
</UL>
