<TITLE> Princess Emeraude (Emma) Celestia </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Princess Emeraude (Emma) Celestia </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  Jadzaea<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Princess Emeraude (Emma) Celestia<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Female Human(?)<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Sky Kingdom Of Celestia (You know, world 5 from Mario 3 . . . the cloudy bit)<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Mario, Toad, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, etc.<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Bowser, Lucius (evil being of light that attempted to invade Celestia)<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Good (but not completely (sort of like Tenchi's Ryoko))<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Emma is tallish, but still just a bit under her cousin, Peach.  She has jet black wavy hair, fair skin, and silver-blue eyes; she wears a sleeveless midnight blue gown with silver trim, long gloves that match her dress, and a brooch with a star sapphire in the center; however, she is usually seen around in a black, loose silk shirt, black leggings, a black cloak, and black leather boots (the outfit she goes adventuring in).<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Emma was born to a very happy King Celestia in 20 B.E. (Before Exor); her mother supposedly died during childbirth.  Celestia grew up very differently from most princesses:  she dreaded the normal things a princess is taught (i.e. curtsying the proper way, how to hold a teacup, etc.) and took up other hobbies (swordplay, magic, tactics, etc.), and her father let her pursue them as she wished.  Although she has strength and skill beyond her years, she is a bit of a clutz.  She looks almost unworldly with her black hair, fair complexion, and silvery-blue eyes.  Rumor has it that she is the daughter of the Goddess Of The Night.<BR>
When she was 21, a being known a Lucius came busting into Celestia and demanding that he be given the throne, for he was a being of light and no mortals should be allowed to rule over any part of the sky.  Emma fought him and won, but he resurfaced as the advisor to the king of Mushroom Kingdom.  Peach, Mario, Luigi, Toad, Bowser, Mallow, and Emma defeated him with the Sword Of Darkness.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Mario RPG, Mario RPG 2 (the incident with Lucius), any of those kart games.  She wouldn't be caught dead in Mario Parties.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Emma still helps her father rule Celestia.  She has kept the Sword Of Darkness, and still uses it in times of great need.  She and Luigi see quite a lot of each other, and rumors of a more permenent relationship between the two are beginning to circulate.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Hopefully, I will finish my fanfic about Emma and post it on Fanfiction.net soon.  It will go into great detail about Lucius, the Sword Of Darkness, and how light and dark do not necessarily mean good and evil (respectively).  There will also be more onher relationship with Luigi, and Toad is an even bigger snot than he was before (hee hee!)<BR>
