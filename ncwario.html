<TITLE> Wario </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Wario </H2> </CENTER>

<B> Mario Games he's been in: </B> <BR>
These are the games where Wario has had an active role.  Sadly, not much. <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Super Mario Land 3:Wario Land- Star Role!!! NO MARIO  or very little!!! HEHEHE!!! 
<LI> Wario Land VB- Star Role!!! Virtual Boy's BEST game  not that it's saying very much 
<LI> Wario Blast- You got me on this one, I have absolutely NO idea why he was in this.  But a cool game never the less
<LI> SMK64 -Surprisingly he was in the later version but not the earlier. He is THE BEST driver
<LI> Wario Land 2- COMING November 9th  unless they delay it 
</UL>
<B> Mario Games he's had a major role in the story: </B> <BR>
These are the games about Wario.  Usually he is the Bad guy. <BR>
<UL>
<LI> SML2- FIRST APPEARANCE!!!  Bad guy who stole Mario's castle
<LI> Wario's Woods- Bad guy in a puzzle game.  Dropped things on toad in a tree.  Go fig.
<LI> Mario Vs Wario- This game I saw in my preview section of NP but it NEVER came out.
</UL>

<B> Mario Games he HASN'T BEEN IN: </B> <BR>
These are the games where Nintendo choose NOT to put in Mario's evil twin. <BR>
<UL>
<LI> SMB:1-3, SMW, SML, SMK- These games were before Wario's time
<LI> SMW2:YI- This doesn't seem right. A baby Wario in leagues with Kameks would have been a perfect arch nemesis for Baby mar and Yoshi.
<LI> SM64- I guess it was too hard to pallete swap Mario to make Wario  or Luigi, for that matter 
</UL>
<B> Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
It's just info about Wario and reasons he has been neglected. <BR>
<UL>
<LI> In SML3:WL, he saved Princess Toadstool's statue from a band of EVIL pirates.  Then MARIO comes along and brings back the statue.  Who gets all the kisses from 'stool-MARIO!
<LI> He was strong enough to singlehandedly take over Mario's Land while he was away in Sarasaland. That's impresive.
<LI> Umm, he had control off some woods for a while in a puzzle game... and he would have gotten away with it to, if not for that meddling Toad!
<LI> He's getting another Game Boy game this late in the systems career. That's more than Mario can say.
<LI> Kicks bomber butt in Wario Blast
<LI> Strongest character in SMK64. THE best driver out there
</UL>
<B> Why People Like Wario: </B> <BR>
Why do people like this lovable loser?  Glad you asked. <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Determination- He tries, and tries, and tries, but can never seem to get his own castle.  And when he does, something always happens and he loses it. Go fig.
<LI> Clothing- Mario is Red/Blue, Luigi is Green/Blue and Wario is Purple/Yellow.  Gotta love different people.   I wonder the tailor is who makes all of those funky overalls.
<LI> Mustaches- Mario's is a little curved, Luigi's is a little bumpy, and Wario's is all over the place. Is that cool or what.
<LI> Shoes- Have you ever noticed his shoes?  They are curved like jester shoes!
<LI> Mystery- Is he Evil to the extreme, or just confused?  The world may never know. Also, why does he shrink at the end of SML3.
<LI> Size- You thought Mario was fat, just look at Wario in the NP comix!
</UL>
