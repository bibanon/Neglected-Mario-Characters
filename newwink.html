<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Wink was born to the same mother as Link. They were seperated at birth because Ganondorf saw these children and knew that one day they would be old enough to destroy his entire empire. So he kidnapped Wink and killed their father in hopes that Link would not be able to take him down alone. When Mario, of all people, saw Ganondorf trying to put a spell on Wink to make him bad. Mario went in and got Wink out of Ganondorf's hands just before he sent Mario out of Hyrule never to return. Wink then wandered around Hyrule wanting nothing more than a friend. One day, he stumbled upon a Fairy Fountain and the fairy there told him that he had a brother somewhere in Hyrule. She then gave him a sword and shield. He set out to find his brother. The fairy also told him about Zelda, the princess of Hyrule, and how her kingdom was being taken over by Ganondorf, the King of the Gerudo. He decided that he would find his brother and they would defeat Ganondorf together. One day Ganondorf popped up out of nowhere and they had a fierce battle. Wink kicked his butt, though. Ganondorf swore they would fight again someday. Wink then saw his brother-Link. He decided that it wasnt the proper time to meet him. He decided he would wait until Link knew he had a brother. Wink then decided to hide out in Kakariko Village until the time was right to reveal himself. To this day, Link still knows nothing of a brother. Maybe Wink will meet Link someday...<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  All Zelda games, Super Smash Bros.(Secret Character), Mario & Link, Zelda: The Adventure of Wink<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Hiding out in Kakariko<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  If Wink were in a Zelda game, he would be Player 2. Therefore, you could have a Zelda game with a Multiplayer Mode. Wink would make a great partner to Link because Link could use a partner.  <BR>
