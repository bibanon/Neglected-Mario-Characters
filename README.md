**Neglected Mario Characters** was a popular little Mario-based webcomic site on the early days of the internet, created by Jay Resop of SMBHQ in his free time in highschool. It was an intensely popular site with a large fanbase, gaining over 200,000 views at it's height in 2004. The comics are quite funny and exciting, and were the first popular "sprite" comics.

This site is a perfect example of a popular site made for fun by two little kids, and their success in creating a fun website with many loyal fans. However, it also frames the slow, crushing decline that came when the Web 2.0 revolution, combined with a grittier, 4chan-influenced culture swamped the internets, right when the admins were least able to compete. 

The [Bibliotheca Anonoma](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki) has archived it here in Github Pages due to the threat of imminent erasure, for better organization, and to get rid of the garish background.
