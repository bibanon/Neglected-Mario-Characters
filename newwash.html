<B>Description of looks:</B>  Is the opposite of the Mushroom Kingdom from SMRPG.  It is swampy, rather than jungly.  The skies are always grey and dark, the grass is blue, the water is purple, and the dirt is orange-red.  Whereas the MK hills have large, friendly eyes, the WK hills have narrow, slany, hostile eyes.  Ragweed covers the ground.  It has locations the opposite of SMRPG.  Examples:<BR>
Pipe House:  Poop House<BR>
Rose Town:   Thorn Town<BR>
Tadpole Pond:  Maggot Marsh<BR>
Midas River:  Fagin Falls<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Home to the most disgraceful and disenchanted citizenry imaginable, the Washroom Kingdom was so named because it is literally as pleasant, appealing, and sanitary as a public restroom.  It's donut-like shape only adds to the notion of living on the rim of a giant, unwashed toilet bowl. This may be due to it's apathetic regent, the naturally hostile nature of it's inhabitants, or it's unpleasant geography, the fact that it's located directly over the fabled Pentagram Path, the grantor of ill wishes and curses, doesn't help either.  It is also rumored to be the hiding place of the legendary Pentagram Pendant, which is sought by evil spirits who would make the entire world as dreary and dismal as the Washroom Kingdom.  Recently, these rumors may have been substantiated by an attempt by a fallen star spirit to enlist the help of several locals to seek out the seven keys which would unlock the box containing the sinister artifact.  Don't be alarmed by these dark circumstances.  For it's inhabitant's, it's just another day in purgatory.<BR>
