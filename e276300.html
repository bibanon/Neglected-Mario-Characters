So does that mean the Internation Convention of Doctors and Blah Blah Blah (I cut it short because it's too long) have a Biochemistry class? Also, why does Dr. Light go there? Does he want to rule the world too? If so, do he and Dr. Wily fight over who gets to rule the world? And does that explain why Dr. Light sent out Mega Man multiple times to stop him?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: (Sigh).  Is Codie's site an official section of NC?  No.  No information about NC Characters that is released in a site that is not NC is not official.  Now, go read Bill and Fred and forget about it.<BR><BR>

Question 299: This question has been stumping me an awful long time. Why did Mario and Luigi change clothing? I mean they started out as Luigi wearing white overalls and a red shirt and Mario started out with a red shirt and red overalls. Then it was red overalls and blue shirt for Mario and green overalls and blue shirt for Luigi. Finally they currently have blue overalls and red shirt for Mario and blue overalls and green shirt for Luigi.....I don't get it. what's next? Red and blue striped overalls and green and blue striped overalls? Please answer this question for I'm so lost in this.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: The answer is very simple.  Nintendo is trying to take over your brain very very slowly by confusing your sence of reality, so you do nothing but buy Pokemon games for the rest of your life.<BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: And I care why?<BR><BR>
