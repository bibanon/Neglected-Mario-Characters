Name: The Angry Sun<BR>
Height: He's a giant celestial body with a bad temper, YOU go measure
him!<BR>
Weight: Same problem as Hot Foot; he roasted the scale<BR>
Age: Celestial+320 (32)<BR>
Nobody knows exactly what made the Sun angry, but a few desert legends
go as follows: The Sun could actually hear what the travellers of the
Koopahari Desert would say about the heat, which soon got on his
nerves.  One night (or was it day, and the Sun was too busy to rise?),
the Sun decided it was time to give the travellers something to complain
about.  So he attacked everyone who said anything about the temperature,
and since then, he's been tormenting anyone who travels the widest
quicksand pit and braves the deser twisters of the unforgiving
Koopahari.  Moral of the story is: If you can't take the heat, get out
of the desert.<BR><BR>

Name: Podoboo<BR>
Height: Like anyone wants to go to the lava pits to measure a ball of
magma that will melt the tape measure.<BR>
Weight: You can't put scales in lava.<BR>
Age: He's an eternal flame (Anyone thinking of a song by The Bengals,
STOP IT RIGHT NOW!)<BR>
Podoboo is a living entity like Fryguy, with a pattern as original as
peanut butter & jelly on whole wheat bread. Bowser meant to create a
giant lava jet that would shoot up from the lava pits and burn bridges,
but he got Podoboo instead (His wand needed batteries). He tried to
create a lava boss from it, but Podoboo had other ideas. Ideas like
jumping out of lava pits endlessly. On Sky World, the elevation has
caused some Podoboos to go in reverse. When Bowser learned that Podoboo
was invincible at first, he stuck with it, but after SMB3 introduces
Starman to fortresses, and Hammer Suits and Tanooki Suits to the Bros.,
Podoboo has become rather annoying to everyone.  Splitting into four
branches, including a blue one (Sparky, Fire Ball, Pyrosphere, and
Podoboo) has done little to help his cause. Oh well...<BR><BR>

Name: Boom-Boom<BR>
Height: About 5-9<BR>
Weight: He just HAD to jump on the scale.  Now I can't weigh anyone
else.<BR>
Age: OLD<BR>
Boom-Boom is an example of advances in video game evolution. He's a
cross between Spiny and a Koopa Troopa, with Bowser's stamina.  The
Koopa Troopa part gives him that flight ability, and he's got Bowser's
leaping talent.  The Spiny part sevres to protect him from stomps at
times, but no one thought to make him fireproof, as a quick defeat of
him goes to the Bros. if they have firepower.  He's roasted in 5 hits.
Sigh.  I guess all that fist waving really didn't scare them after all.<BR><BR>

Name: Hammer Bros. & the Family<BR>
Height: Same as Super Mario<BR>
Weight: I'd know if they'd ditch the weapons long enough.  At least they
fixed the scale.<BR>
Age: Various, from 18 to 24<BR>
The Hammer bros knew what they were doing when thy tried pounding the
Mario Bros. like nails with their hammers.  When they returned in SMB3,
they'd come from a worldwide vacation, on which they picked up their
relatives.  From Australia: the dual shot, double trouble Boomerang
Bros.  From New York: the haevy-hitting, 222 pound, tremor-causing
Sledge Bros.  And from somewhere under Mt. Krakatoa: the Twin Toasters
themselves, the Fire Bros.  Hammer-hoisting gave the Hammer and Sledge
Bros.  some SERIOUS jumping ability, but the others fell short.  They
wreaked havoc on the Mushroom Worlds until the Mario Bros came along and
defeated them all.  Even earthquakes and sledgehammers couldn't stop
them.  On Dinosaur World, Amazin' Flying Hammer Bros.  tried to hammer
out some dents in Bowser's plans, but they still failed.  Oh well, can't
win 'em all...<BR><BR>

Name: Spike<BR>
Age: 21 or so<BR>
Weight: 167 (Could someone please do something about the spiked ball in
my scale?)<BR>
Height: Whatever Mario's height is<BR>
Gender: Male, for the most part.<BR>
Likes: Swimming, ice, pointed objects<BR>
Hates: Ptooies, droughts, dull razors<BR>

Spike was the last turtle to enter Bowser's army. He was given the
ability to produce an endless amount of spiked balls (in a most
disgusting manner), and climbing abilites. He lives by water, ans this
makes the perfect spot to relax, and the Mario Bros. won't dare tread
near water (they're plumbers, they see enough water). Spike never though
of making himself fireproof, so he declined the offer to join Bowser on
his trip to Dinosaur World in SMW. Spike decided to take over the
Mushroom Kingdom with his friends, but they declined before they got out
the front door of Castle Koopa. to quote Spike at this time "It was too
much @%#$ work!"<BR><BR>

Name: Bob-Omb<BR>
Age: ....... Uh........... 28?..........<BR>
Weight: Just one second, I fixed the scale, and I have Bob-Omb on it,
and [BOOM!].... Never mind....<BR>
Height: Twice as tall as half their height ;-)<BR>
Gender: Artillery, who cares?!<BR>
Likes: Fire, exploding, lightning<BR>
Hates: Wigglers, Wendy O. Koopa<BR>

Bob-Ombs are less dangerous than most other foes. That is, until they
lose their temper. Then... BOOOOOOOOM! No more Bob-Omb. Mario hates
being blasted, but likes using them to blast walls and enemies. Bob-Ombs
would rather soak in Island World. Thanks to Wendy O. Koopa, they can
swim, but they blame her for removing their arms later on. The Giant
Bob-Omb of SM64 was actually the first Bob-Omb created. He went through
a door on Land of the Giants, and grew to large proportions. Afer a few
years, he fought Mario. Now, rumor has it that he's forming a resistance
against Wart. Hmmm...<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
Wow, thats a lot of bios.  good job.
<BR><BR>

<B>Multiple Bios By, SD Yoshi Blue</B><BR>

-name: Bloober (alternative spelling: "Blooper")<BR>
-race: some kind of jellyfish or calalmari-style creature.<BR>
-age: your average jellyfish only lives for about one year. I've
checked.<BR>
-blood type: Not sure if jellyfish bleed, and anyway, the cances of ever
seeing blood in a Mario game are of ten million to one.<BR>
-gender: I don't think there's a difference between male and female
jellyfish.<BR>
-occupation: Mario baddie.<BR>
-size: About as big as Mario, wich is pretty huge for a jellyfish.<BR>
-habitat: The sea, obviously.<BR>
-weight: Can't be all that heavy.<BR>
-first appearance: Super Mario Bros.<BR>
-gaming career: The Bloober's first, and arguably most memorable
appearance was in the original SMB, where they infested the underwater
sections. Tricky to avoid, and impossible to kill without a fire flower,
Bloobers were considered as some of the most fearsome SMB enemies. Their
toughness worked as a bit of a two-sided sword: there were players who
liked a challenge and respected the mighty Bloober, but easily
frustrated players hated Bloober 'till they could hate no more. Still,
he made a comeback in the Lost Levels (SMB2 to the Japanese), where he
was pretty much the same as before, except for one new skill: in certain
non-underwater levels, Bloober appeared, floating in the air. These
levels were usually infested with tricky jumps over bottomless pits, and
the floating Bloobers proved to be a major nuisance. A jump on their
head would see them off (unlike the swimming Bloobers who could kill you
upon any contact), but it was still risky. SMB3 featured Bloobers as
well, but there was no more floating around: this time they stayed in
the water. But, to compensate, they were now usually accompanied by a
group of baby Bloobers-completely in fashion with the slight baby boom
that seemed to be going on in SMB3 (the Koopa kids, micro Goombas, and
now this...)-who would follow the "big" Bloober (I say big, but they
actually looked smaller than before in SMB3) around the screen. A couple
of years later, the Bloober was used as a piece in the puzzle game
Mario&Yoshi on the NES and GB. Bloober's last appearance so far has been
in SMRPG, where they patrolled the area around the entrance to the sea.<BR>
-future prospects: Although we haven't seen anything of the Bloober for
quite a while now, he's still a pretty well-known Mario baddie, and I'd
reckon he'll make a comeback someday. He may appear in Mario Party
somewhere, but I'm not sure a bout that.<BR>
-mysteries: Do the Bloobers ever get washed ashore? Can they breathe
outside of water? That's all I really wonder about, wich is surprisingly
little for an element of the ever-illogical Mario saga.....<BR><BR>

-name: Blarrg<BR>
-race: a lava creature or something....<BR>
-age: unknown<BR>
-size: varies<BR>
-occupation: minion of Bowser<BR>
-blood type: No idea, but he's probably a hot-blooded sort of person....<BR>
-habitat: lives in lava pools<BR>
-gender: probably male.<BR>
-weight: Not a clue<BR>
-known relatives: In YI, they bear a striking resemblance to a monster
called Nep-enuts<BR>
-likes and dislikes: Is probably not to keen on Yoshi. Probably gets a
big bang out of scaring people by jumping out of the lava and shouting
"boo!" at them. Um....maybe.<BR>
-first appearance: Super Mario World<BR>
-gaming career: In certain levels of SMW, Mario had to dodge growling,
dragon-like creatures that popped out of the lava beneath him. These
were the Blarrgs. Their role was only small, but they were re-used in
Yoshi's Island, however, they had changed a lot. Instead of looking like
dragons, they were now big red humps of lava with a (very cute) face on
them. They came in small and big sizes, the big ones chasing Yoshi
around. They now made a crashing sound upon emerging from the lava, as
opposed to their "growling" sound effect in SMW. Tetris Attack featured
a Blarrg called Gargantua Blarrg as a playable character, and also as an
opponent in the stroy mode. Yoshi's Story saw a third type of Blarrg.
They looked a bit like the ones in YI, but larger, and with more
elaborate faces and skin colours.<BR>
-future prospects: Blarrgs seem to be exclusive to Yoshi games now. A
new Yoshi game is quite a likely prospect, but it won't be with us
anytime soon....<BR>
-mysteries: There's something very wierd here....three very
different-looking enemies each share the same name. How do the
dragon-like Blarrgs from SMW relate to those in the Yoshi games? Since
the Yoshi games take place before any of the other Mario games, the SMW
version may be a more eveolved form of the Blarrg. But honestly, your
guess is as good as mine. This is another one of those unfathomable
Mario mysteries.<BR><BR>

-name: Para-Beetle<BR>
-age: unknown, but bugs don't grow very old, usually, do they?<BR>
-weight: that shell looks pretty heavy....<BR>
-blood type: um....do insects bleed? No idea, frankly.<BR>
-gender: unknown<BR>
-race: insect<BR>
-known relatives: is probably related to the Buzzy Beetle<BR>
-habitat: clouds.<BR>
-occupation: serves in Bowser's army.<BR>
-first appearance: SMB3<BR>
-gaming career: The Para-Beetles have only had one tiny little
appearance, in one single level of SMB3's sky world (I think it was
level 5-7?). All they did was fly in a big swarm accross the screen, but
the trick was that they were all Mario could stand on in that one level,
so he had to hop from beetle to beetle in order to make it to end of
this pretty tricky level. And that's it. That's all we've ever seen of
them.<BR>
-future prospects: don't hold our breath. They were probably a one-time
only kind of deal.<BR>
-mysteries: one question must be asked: why did they appear so little?
Why haven't we seen any of them since SMB3? I quite liked their look
(the red shell was cute), and there's got to be some more potential in
them than just that tiny showing in SMB3. Come on, Nintendo, give them
another chance!<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
Nice work.  Very comprehence bios.  Would you mind if I "use" some of these topics such as "future prospects" and "mysteries" in my bios?
