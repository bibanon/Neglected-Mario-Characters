Question 180: Donez want a cracker?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Why sure, I love crackers. Wait a minute! Is this an insult? Are you comparing me to a parrot? Dang, I'm mad! But can I still have the cracker? <BR><BR>
Question 181: Define 'avuncular.'<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...avuncular...Have I said yet that English isn't my best subject? I'll give it a try anyway... Does it mean, "To swat repeatedly to death with a rake"? <BR><BR>

Question 186: Out of all the Neglected Characters, who throws the best parties?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I'd have to say Toad. Dang, that kid always seems to be drunk, but his parties rule. Plus he's always giving stuff away to his guests. Just last week I got a P-wing. Too bad I don't know how to use it. <BR><BR>
Question 187: a+b=c<BR>
a is the mass of the sun in 3'x3' sheets of wood.<BR>

Question 189: 'D'oh' is a contraction of which two words?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...I Donno. D'oh! <BR><BR>
Question 190: Where's your other wing?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I'll have to blame bad two-dimentional NES graphics on this one. <BR><BR>
Question 191: When will you get your own game?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I was working on a game called "Super Dr. Donez! Bros." But then I realized that I did't have a brother. The project is currently on hold. <BR><BR>
Question 192: Did you really know that 'nez' is the French word for 'beak?' Because that is such a coincidence otherwise.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No, I didn't know. Plus Jay doesn't know a word of French. Or English for that matter. But don't tell him I said that. So yes, that is a really weird coincidence. <BR><BR>
Question 193: What does Shane look like in person?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I really don't know. I've only had the chance to meet him once, but he had a paper bag over his head. <BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: Dang, I should know this. Bah, I forgot. <BR><BR>
Question 195: Do you remember any other cool cartoons from the 80's?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: The Smurfs. They ruled. <BR><BR>
Question 196: Will I ever quit referring to the '80s?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: God, I hope so. <BR><BR>
Question 197: How old are you, Doctor?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: You know? I forgot. I bet I'm around fifty or something. Or was that thirty? Or was that one hundred? I remember serving in the Spanish-American War, as a medical doctor, if that helps you at all. <BR><BR>
Question 198: How many patients have you saved?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Quite a lot, actually. I have a knack for things medical. Most of the time they don't pay the bill though. Cheap bums. How do I work on my weapons of Mass Desruction if I don't get paid? <BR><BR>
Question 199: How many have you lost?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Lets just not get into that...too many bad memories. <BR><BR>
Question 200: How do you operate with only one wing? It must be hard.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I have two wings! Its all Nintendo's fault for their bad programming and graphics! I demand retribution! OK, I'm better now.<BR><BR>
