<B>Other Comments:</B>  Puh-lease put this guy up on the Comix, Jay! We haven't seen a Blk. Mage on the stands yet! Let him be on Mario Busters first! (Hopefully Codie Kitty won't screw it up, though) Also, put him in an NC Deathmatch, I don't care if he loses, just as long as he's in there! I even got some sprites of him for you!<BR>
