Neglected Character News for 6/13/11<BR>
<UL><LI>Eh. Lack of interest from the fans has sort of curtailed any reason for me to do things. However, I did ensure the site does not accidentally confuse people into thinking it is linked to Jay; although some links may still note his name, it should be abundantly clear this is an unofficial mirror now. -MM</UL><BR>


Neglected Character News for 4/9/11<BR>
<UL><LI>The NC Mirror is up, in all its glory. New content is likely to follow in a bit. In the meantime, enjoy the faster loading times, lack of ads, and slightly less cluttered file layout! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/13/11<BR>
<UL><LI>Just a new Short up today, noting NC/SSS being completed and also poking a bit of fun at one of the more crazy ideas people had for NC back when. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/12/11<BR>
<UL><LI><a href="nsdos/13/comix.html">NC/SSS Mach 2 Part 13</a>!!! Can you believe it? I hardly can. After 5 years, multiple attempts to make it, and more, it is finally here. It may not be the best rendition possible (ideally Jay and/or Lord Reid would have made it) but between Pat and I it worked out. So, enjoy! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/9/11<BR>
<UL><LI>Alph's <a href="asas/4/comix.html">A Story About Something</a> has updated again. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/14/10<BR>
<UL><LI>Life sucks, NC isn't updated much anymore, SMBHQ is dead, so here is this short. Don't bug me for updates--I don't have the time to do them at the moment. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/18/10<BR>
<UL><LI>Took off the evil month of February. But we haven't been slouching, because Alph has made <a href="asas/3/comix.html">One heck of a Long Part 3</a> to his 'A Story About Something'! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/31/10<BR>
<UL><LI>Hello there.  MetalMan has been doing great for the last year or so and will continue to do the bulk of the updates, however there was this short I would just dying to do and I finally had time to do it.  Enjoy.-SK</UL><BR>


Neglected Character News for 1/30/10<BR>
<UL><LI>Here's a sprite sheet by Mushman, of <a href="sprites.html">Biggs and Wedge</a>! And another part in the <a href="pa/2/comix.html">Metal Man's EXTREME Presidential Adventure</a> series! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/17/10<BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/11/10<BR>
<UL><LI>After a lot of inactivity on my part (but not on the Short makers) I have finally figured out a way to start making some NC comix of my own without eating too much of my time... in the meantime, enjoy this Short by DarkZero. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/27/09<BR>
<UL><LI>Merry Belated Christmas! Here's a new short from MushMan, while I contemplate on being too slow. TOO SLOW. Also, no more Christmas background. Hooray! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 11/26/09<BR>
<UL><LI>Another update, a month later. Similar to the past one, in which it is a new short and <a href="sprites.html">a sprite sheet for Magruder, Zadok, and Executrain</a> are up. Happy Thanksgiving. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/26/09<BR>
<UL><LI>Two updates in one month? I'm as surprised as you are. A new short and <a href="sprites.html">sprite sheet for Captain Churro</a> are up! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/09/09<BR>
<UL><LI>Another month passes. I find it strange that I am the only one updating this site. Er, anyway! A new short, and <a href="asas/2/comix.html">another part of Alph's story about something</a>... it even has me in it! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 09/07/09<BR>
<UL><LI>Two months later, we see primarily a short contributed by Jayboy. Perhaps if more people contributed I'd have more to put here. Oh yeah, and it's NC's 12th birthday. Meh. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 06/07/09<BR>
<UL><LI>After a bit of a break, we've gotten a <a href="sprites.html">Dr. Donez sprite sheet</a> up, thanks to Mush Man! I'll get to some real stuff soon enough. EDIT FROM THE YEAR 2011: DO NOT EMAIL ME, I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT NC -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 04/24/09<BR>
<UL><LI>What's this? Another <a href="death21.html">Deathmatch</a>? Why, yes it is. Enjoy! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 04/21/09<BR>
<UL><LI>Sorry about that, I was flakin' out, Jay style. Not to fear, there's a new short, and I'm planning on doing SOMETHING every week or so. I just had to warm up my brain. Heh. Heheh. Heheheheh. -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 03/01/09<BR>

Neglected Character News for 02/28/09<BR>
<UL><LI>A while later, I know, but Calculus can be time-absorbing. Never to fear, though, Alph has created <a href="asas/1/comix.html">A Story About Something</a> for us to read! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 02/06/09<BR>
<UL><LI>This is your president speaking! I've put up the <a href="death20.html">New Deathmatch</a> for Sean, since he appeared to be busy. don't worry--he approved it before I put it up. Enjoy! -MM</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/23/08<BR>
<UL><LI>In our continuous effort to pretend like NC is still updated regularly, a NEW comic is up!  Yipee!  Special thanks to CSM for keeping The Lord of the Wings going!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/20/08<BR>
<UL><LI>As promised, TWO new comics are online.  (Neither made by myself, but who's counting.)  We have the next part in the Mushroom Wars Special Edition by Alph, and (GASP) the next new part in the Lord of the Wings by Crazyswordsman!  Wowee!  Who'd've-thunk-it?</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/20/08<BR>
<UL><LI>Happy 64th Short!  Wow...over a year since my last one.  That's...sad.  Anyway, I was bored tonight, and I had a silly idea, so I threw something together.  Tomorrow, I actually have two new comics that will go online.  I'd put them up now...but it's 2am and I'm tired.  So you can wait a little while longer.  Ye-haw!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/6/08<BR>
<UL><LI>All Hail the New Year!  So long, 2007!  Anyway, Happy Last Day of Christmas.  As promised, here is the 2nd (Last) Part of the 2007 Christmas Comic made by Sean Kelly.  Enjoy!  (If you dare...BWAHAHAHAHA...er...right...)</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/27/07<BR>
<UL><LI>Since I'm too lazy to update (Read: Insanely busy), Sean has done it for me!  Yay!  Happy holidays, everyone in internetland!  Oh, and for the record, I don't do that facebook/myplace/myface stuff.  So don't bother looking for me.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/20/07<BR>
<UL><LI>Sorry, nothing really new.  Just messing around with a few things.  And I missed NC's 10th bithday (Sad emoticon).  Anyway, take care.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/26/07<BR>
<UL><LI>Hey all, heh.  Just a note to let you all know I'm alive.  I don't want to get into it here, but there's been a bunch of personal stuff going on in life that has kept me busy.  Let's just say it involved a day in April.  I'm alright though.  I don't know how updates are going to work, though.  I'm open for any fan ideas you may have.  But for now, I have Part 9 of the Special Edition of the Mushroom Wars up by Alph.  Besides that, I may work on more Ask Dr. Donez, maybe a Short if I get an idea, and maybe a Deathmatch (I've been meaning to do a new one of those for years...heh.)  Anyway, take care, everyone.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/13/07<BR>
<UL><LI>Happy new year!  Heh.  New: Short.  The comic was written for the Super Mario Wiki, a cool Mario site.  Also new: Part 7 of the Mushroom Wars Special Edition by Alph.  Soon: Stuff?  Perhaps?  Maybe?</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 12/14/06<BR>
<UL><LI>A quick update so you all know I'm alive.  Going by site updates, you may not know that, heh.  Anyway, while my new graduate program will most likely suck out all of my life energy and chi (You gatta have chi), I do have small plans to keep NC going.  Right now, I'm mainly looking at continuing Ask Dr. Donez.  As well as maybe doing that Crappy Comic Contest.  I'm sure someone, maybe me, will finish NC/SSS at some point.  Oh, and I'm sure I have some other stuff that needs to be posted too.  Just remind me if I forgot anything.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 9/13/06<BR>
<UL><LI>As you've noticed, I've been too busy to update NC, sadly.  I'm really sorry.  In my heart of hearts, I wish I could just update NC all of the time.  I still love this site.  But I simply don't have that much time anymore.  Other stuff just comes up all of the time.  Some random person sent me this short today, and so I put it up for no real reason.  But if anyone asks, the author of the short says to tell you that he's awesome.  Maybe I should start a "Crappy Short" contest, and see who can submit the worst comic?  We can have people vote on the crappiest.  Sound like fun at all?</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/28/06<BR>
<UL><LI>I'm updating NC so that Curt goes to school.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/18/06<BR>
<UL><LI>Heh, after seven months, I finally make a new Short.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/18/06<BR>
<UL><LI>This is finally going up two months later than it should have, but here is finally NC/SSS Part 12, written by Lord Reid.  I want to thank Reid a lot for his hard work in continuing NC/SSS even though I've been unable to really help that much.  Maybe I'll be able to do the next episode.  Anyway, I haven't even seen the new NC/SSS yet, but I'm sure it's good.  It's Lord Reid, afterall.  I blame my lack of updates on the fact that I'm in the middle of writing my master's thesis right now.  Most of you probably don't know what that is, but just trust me.  I have been unable to do anything besides work or worry about this thing for the last few months.  Anyway, enjoy the new NC/SSS!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/13/06<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow...is that date right?  It's May???  What happened to April...and March...  Heh, anyway, I'm really sorry about that.  A few problems came up.  First, graduate school is killing me.  Second, over a month ago, my computer started to give me problems, and a few weeks ago, it finally blew up on me.  I just got a new laptop, so I'm able to update again.  So for now I put up the next part of the special edition of the Mushroom Wars that Alph made.  I also have in my possession the next episode of NC/SSS, made by Lord Reid.  So I plan to put up Part 12 of the NC/SSS Crossover Mach 2, hm, hopefully sometime this week.  Most of all, I'm really sorry that I missed April Fools this year.  Maybe I'll be able to make it up to you all some how...</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/14/06<BR>
<UL><LI>Gasp!  A new comic!  The next part of NC/SSS!  GAPS!!!  Maybe I'll actually get some inspiration for a Short comic or something this week...</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/21/06<BR>
<UL><LI>Heh.  Um...Happy New Year.  Heh.  Well, the good news is that there is a NEW COMIC.  Well, it's not really new, it's sort of a remake.  And it's not really new, because it's already been posted in the NC Forum.  And it isn't made by me, it's made by Alph from the NC Forum.  But never-the-less, NEW COMIC!!!  Heh.  But wait!  There's more!  This week I'll also be posting an actual NEW comic, the next part of the NC/SSS CROSSOVER!  Made by Sean.  Heh.  Yay!  I also have a couple of new Short ideas, and I'll be updating Ask Dr. Donez.  So keep and eye out on NC!  Stuff will be updated.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 11/22/05<BR>
<UL><LI>I'm on a roll now.  Two Shorts in three months?  Wow!  I'm smok'n!  Seriously, though, I apologize for being asleep at the wheel here.  Life just takes over sometimes.  I don't know how funny this new Short really is, but think of it as a "warm-up" for myself.  I've been out of the comicing loop for a little while, and I need to oil up the old gears and all before I'm back up to speed.  But I have some ideas for some new stuff around here, so expect some more updates faster.  Be on the look out.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 10/3/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow.  I stink.  :(</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/15/05<BR>
<UL><LI>At last, the final part of NC/SSS Part 10 is up online.  Now, hopefully this means that I'll be able to have Part 11 up soon.  The more you all bug me about it, the faster it'll get done.  So feel free to e-mail me about it.  Also, the next part of the Mario Busters flash movie by Glyph is up.  Enjoy!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 8/9/05<BR>
<UL><LI>New Short.  I'll probably be answering some of the Ask Dr. Donez questions I get from e-mails in future Short comics like this, so if you want your question to appear in a comic, please send it to my e-mail address, and you could get lucky.  More stuff I have to throw up on the site soon.  Like the next NC/SSS and Mario Busters Movie.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/28/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow, almost two months in between Shorts.  I'm getting rusty.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 7/18/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Ack!  I'm sorry about the little delay again.  I got sidetracked from the site.  Anyway, there are some updates up.  First, is the next part of NC/SSS Part 10.  Next, is Chapter 1 of the Mario Busters Flash Movie.  And last, is some new Ask Dr. Donez questions.  You all need to bug me to update more!  Heh.  Anyway, hopefully some more stuff soon.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/21/05<BR>
<UL><LI>The next NC/SSS is up.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/8/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Bunch of stuff today.  New part of the NC/SSS Part 10, new Short, and new Ask Dr. Donez questions.  Send in more questions to Ask Dr. Donez!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 6/1/05<BR>
<UL><LI>The next part of NC/SSS Part 10 is up!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 5/27/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Wow...  Um...  Hi!  Heh...  So yeah, I think the Short explains everything.  But you should all be glad to know that Reid has finished NC/SSS Part 10.  I'm going to break it up into weekly updates, so I have something easy to update around here, heh.  I'm going to see if I can start making new Shorts again, too.  As soon as I get some inspiration...heh.  Oh, I also put up a link to the Mario Busters Flash Movie, being made by Glyph Phoenix.  It looks pretty cool so far, if I say so myself.  Right now it's just the Prologue.  But more will be made soon I suppose.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 4/2/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Heh.  Hope you all had a good April Fools yesterday.  I don't think I fooled many of you with my joke, but I hope everyone at least had a good laugh at it.  If you didn't see it, it's up now as "Vernachlässigte Mario Buchstaben".  Be sure to check out both the "English" version of the site that I made as well as the "Which New Is" page on the joke site.  I changed both of those as part of the joke.  I personally think "Solicit General Practitioner Donez", "Compute You the Extra Chap" and "Introvert against Introvert" are particularly funny, heh.  So yeah, hope you all enjoyed.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/21/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Let's give it up for the NEW President of NC, Captain Churro!  Bill had a good run, but I guess he just wasn't popular enough for a second term.  Bill has not made any comments as of yet about losing the presidency, but we expect some shortly.  Stay tuned for more info on this breaking story.  Also, new Short.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/13/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Vote NOW for the next NC president.  The winner of the election will become the new President of NC, with all of the powers that come with such a high and, um, powerful, office.  So make sure you vote!  Voting will end March 20th, so make sure you do it soon!  Or you'll forget!  Send your vote of either Bill the Extra Guy, Yoshi, Captain Churro, Dr. Donez, or Bowser to <A HREF="mailto:nmcmail@gmail.com">nmcmail@gmail.com</A>.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 3/6/05<BR>
<UL><LI>New Short.  I really do plan to start the next Lord of the Wings soon.  Really.  I mean it.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/27/05<BR>
<UL><LI>First, new Short.  I have no idea what I was thinking with this one, so don't ask.  Second, new Ask Dr. Donez questions.  So go read and enjoy those.  About 50 new questions were answered.  Finally, I set a date for the General Election voting for NC Election 2004.  The voting will run from March 13th through March 19th.  Voting will be done similar to how we did the primaries, basically, by e-mail.  I'll let you know more about how to vote when it gets closer to the 13th.  Until then, the Campaign Managers are given two more weeks in order to campaign their candidates and try to get as many people as possible to vote for their character.  So yeah, with that, I leave you for now.  My next project is to finally finish the next episode of Lord of the Wings...let's see how long it takes me...heh.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/16/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Happy 50th Short!</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 2/2/05<BR>
<UL><LI>I should just rename the site "Shy vs Shy".</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/28/05<BR>
<UL><LI>School started, so I've been a little busy.  But here's a new Short for ya.  More stuff soon...I hope...heh.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/12/05<BR>
<UL><LI>Bored Jay = Shy vs Shy.</UL><BR>

Neglected Character News for 1/7/05<BR>
<UL><LI>The second part of the belated Christmas Short.  Happy new year, happy holidays, and all of that jazz.</UL><BR>
