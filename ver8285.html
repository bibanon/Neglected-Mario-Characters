Looks: Like a cross between a fish and a plant<BR>
Lives: About every pipe in the Mushroom Kingdom, Bowser’s Castle<BR>
Likes: Plant food, red & green overalls<BR>

Hobbies: Biting Mario & Luigi, eating plant food<BR>
Wants: A bunch of servants to feed her red & green overalls all day<BR>
Is currently: In the Mushroom Kingdom, begging Bowser to let them back
in.<BR>

Kamek, the king of Magikoopas, created the piranha plant tribe. They
were always hungry so Bowser sent them on a mission to get rid of Mario
& Luigi. It was a good idea, for piranha plants liked red & green
overalls. Unfortunately, fireballs destroyed most of them. Two were
left. You know what happened- married, had some kids, were fruitful and
multiplied. After a while it came to take on the Mario brothers again.
They tried to get the overalls again. One of them did it, and showed
Mario’s underwear! He quickly left to change, came out and blew it up
with a fireball. They were used many times but were defeated every time!
Angrily, Bowser sent the clan away, vowing never to use them again! They
left. Suddenly they noticed a spaceship! They got on. The clan was taken
to a world called Hyrule. They were sent to a dream when they got there
but ANOTHER hero defeated them- this one named Link. They left the
world, hoping to find a better place. They hurried to Bowser in order to
get back. They probably will get back in the tribe, but who knows?<BR>

<B> Reznor By, Ramatis</B><BR>

                      "...Bowser's second-most Unique Sub-Boss..."<BR>

Vital Stats:<BR>

Gender/Race: Male,Triceratops<BR>
Age: A Bazillion Jillion<BR>
Height: Gigantic<BR>
Weight: 180 Tons<BR>
Likes: Bossing people around,Always winning<BR>
Hates: Annoying employees,Luigi,cute animal racers,Losing<BR>
Aliases: Tricky,BP Richfeild<BR>
Lives in: Numerous Fortresses,a Trailer at WeSaySo Inc. 60 million B.C,A Spiraly Mountain<BR>


     Reznor(Aka Tricky and Mr. Richfeild) was Bowser's top Sub-Boss in SMW. He was a worthy enemy for MARIO,and his fortresses were really decent.
   Reznor invented this really cool duplicating machine and made 3 clones of himself. So when MARIO came along,there would be 4 Reznors on a turning wheel with four platforms,spitting fireballs at him over a cheap,easy-to-break bridge. He was quite sure MARIO would never make it. And he didn't.  But suddenly LUIGI came along and kicked 'em around.
       But WHO,pray got the full praise? MARIO! Anyway,Reznor tried again and again to defeat them so Koopa wouldn't have to,but failed as long as LUIGI was around!
        King Koopa was so upset about Reznor's poor performance,that he was kicked off the force at the end of SMW. Reznor was terribly dissapointed.
          But while Diddy Kong Racing was in the making,the programmers suddenly have run out of ideas for a racing boss for Dino Domain. Reznor signed up for the job,dyed his scales red,and renamed himself "Tricky Triceratops" and became a racing boss for Diddy Kong Racing. However,he was dissapointed to learn he was the first easy boss to defeat. So after 1 month of auditioning(for the race and the ending sequence),Tricky left Nintendo,claiming for good,and went to his own habitat in his own time.
       The red dye eventually peeled off while he was around,but he was finally appreatiated.
  He signed up to be the boss of a Tree Pushing company called "WeSaySo".
        In the form,on the name line,Tricky wrote "Mr. Reznor Richfeild" and that was that.
    Reznor Richfeild became a very powerful and rich dinosaur afterwards. All his employees cowardly shook in fear of his presence. However,there was another glitch to take care of.
      Earl Sinclair,one of the braver employees of WeSaySo,often but Richfeild in many knots.
  Richfeild was often annoyed with him. So with every little mistake he did,he'll pull down the window,poke his face out,and yell
"SINCLAIR! In here! NOW!!!"
      Everyone else would cower in fear of his voice,but Earl got him every time. But it was time for revenge.
       On the last episode of Dinosaurs,Mr. Richfeild had destoryed the world. His company buildings wiped out the whole species of a certain bug which ate annoying weeds every year.
   Earl was supposed to deal with the blasted annoyance of the ever-growing Cider Poppies,but did everything Mr. Richfeild Suggested.
      "Weed Killer all over the world!" was Richfeild's order,so Earl sent in the Weed Killer.
   Unfortunatley,the weed killer also killed every single plant in the world. FOOD SHORTAGE!  They needed to make rain,but needed clouds to make rain.
    "Bomb all the volcanoes!"was Reznor Richfeild's order. "Then we'll have all kinds of clouds to make rain!"
        Another mistake. The cloud were too much. They completley blocked out the sun,making it cold. So instead of rain coming down,it was snowing.
       The snow was said not to dissappear for many years,but Richfeild didn't mind. He had his WeSaySo warming up products that people needed,so he was filthy rich!
         There was his happy ending. 
 As of right now,Reznor/Tricky/Richfeild's whereabouts are unknown. Prehaps he's dead? Or maybe he went into the hear future in time? No one knows. Maybe not even Nintendo.

"Sinclair,I am a very powerful dinosaur...and you're...just...a puny nothing."<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
Yet another bio by Ramatis
<BR><BR>

<B> Shy Guy(s) Part 2 By, Ramatis</B><BR>

  As we last left off, in YI, Baby Bowser got so upset for doing all that hard work for nothing, he killed off many Shy Guys and injured Kamek. So Kamek and what was left of the Shy guy group went through a time portal to go in the future.
     But Baby Bowser silently crawled behind them and was caught in the Time Warp with them. Kamek decided to write out a peace contract and they would go in the near future to seek World Domination. Mwa ha ha haa….
        So they went into the future. They found that other guy no one should really care about trying to rule the world again. So, again, they easily pushed him back and took over the future of Yoshi’s Island.
      Kamek again won Janken(aka Rocks, Paper, and Scissors in Japanese) over the Shy Guys and took over. And yet again, the Shy Guys were the common enemy of YS.
      In the bargain back at the Time Warp, Baby Bowser himself wanted to run the plan all by himself. Kamek sighed and agreed. So he was in his own private office overlooking everyone’s progress on a monitor throughout the entire game.
      Baby Bowser’s plan was indeed very hideous and horrible. Not to mention very evil!
   He stole the SUPER HAPPY TREE!!! The key of happiness of all Yoshi’s Island.
       What made the  Yoshis so happy?  Why did a common tree make the Yoshis smile with glee?
               It’s the sugar, I tell ya. Those happy, innocent-looking fruits that grow on that blasted tree are really bulging with pink sugary sweetness that keeps the Yoshis going.
    Now that Bowser has taken the tree, they can no longer have their wonderful, sweet, cavity-causing fruit. So their happiness drops to a negative point so low that they can hardly do a thing.
          Then 8(count Black and White) baby Yoshis hatched right after the tree was taken. And since they’ve never seen the Super Happy Tree(and never had that fruit ^_^) they all wonder why every single other Yoshi is so sad.
     They soon learn by our own Yoshi we know and love, so they set out to bring it  back.

       Somehow, the Black and White Yoshis seemed to have gotten separated from the others. So that’s why they can only be found in certain levels.
     While thefting the Super Happy Tree, a lot of fruit  on loose vines dropped in a trail that led to the castles.  One Shy Guy noticed  the dropped fruit. It was too late to send in others to clean it out before the Yoshis arrived and he couldn't pick up ALL that fruit by himself, so he used a magic trick that Kamek taught him and but up many of the fruit in bubbles.
       So when the Yoshis arrived at certain levels, they would find many Shy Guys carrying Happy Fruit to the castle’s stash. In which they could easily take away from them.
       Now, as for the floating Happy Fruit, I’m stuck on. I assume that they weren’t really Happy Fruit at all. Just balloons that look like them. But, however, in this game, it’s really the thought that counts, so the balloons don’t affect the Yoshis one bit.
            But…..as we all know, not all of the Shy Guys were evil.
     The Shy Guys in a White cloak were rebels against Kamek and Baby Bowser, as with the other Shy Guys. They still worship the KKK, but they hate everything else evil. Many of the other Shy Guys made fun of them wearing white, and since they were such powder puffs.
       So the White Shy Guys always lent a helping hand to the Yoshis whenever they discovered them.<BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
See if you can find Ramatis' first shy guy bio befroe you read this one.

<B>Skeeter By, Pokemaniac </B><BR>

1st appaerance: Super Mario 64    ( and sadly his last )<BR>
Species: Water Skimmer , Male<BR>
Likes: Water<BR>
Hates: Mario<BR>


  Bowser, who took over Peach's castle, and stole the Power Stars,
realized he needed stronger and more challenging enemies. among these new
troops was
 Skeeter, a green water skimmer. Skeeter patrolled the watery places in
the castle. 
 time and time again, he was squished, stomped on, punched, kicked, and 
 generally thrown around by Mario. soon, he grew tired of being
neglected.
 So, he generally ignored Mario. However, He was still smashed, Kicked,
and
 punched. soon, he developed a strategy. he would stay on top of the
water far from shore, so mario couldn't fight him. Skeeter's strategy
worked well. unfortunetly, 
 it didn't stop Mario, who stayed away from skeeter. Mario soon found all
of the stars
 in that area. that really ticked Skeeter off, too. Still, Skeeter waits
for Mario to come 
 back, and has been ever since, so he can really lett Mario have it good.<BR>
