<B>Link Games he has been in: </B><BR>
Well, all of them.  But here are all of them listed out.<BR>

<UL>
<LI> Legend of Zelda-Link's first quest.  Saves Zelda, defeats Gannon, and eats some pie.<BR>
<LI> Legend of Zelda 2:Link's Adventure-Link's second quest.  Saves Zelda, defeats Gannon, eats some pie, and finds a dollar in a parking lot.<BR>
<LI> Legend of Zelda 3:A Link to the Past-I don't know where this game fits into the series.  I think the story comes before the first too.<BR>
<LI> Legend of Zedla 4:Link's Awakening-BEST LINK GAME OF ALL TIME!!!  ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME!!!  This one can fit after any of the first 3 games.  I think the story places it after A Link to the Past.<BR>
<LI> Zelda 64:The Orcana of Time-I havn't played this game much.  All I know is that Link sounds like a girl in this one.<BR>
</UL>

<B>Stories that need to be told: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> HOW IN THE HECK DO THE STUPID STORIES GO TOGETHER!!!-Man, I'm still a little confused with A Link to the Past but when you look at all the stories at once...wow.  Nintendo needs to write a book tying them all together.<BR>
<LI> Marin-She ruled.  She needs to come back.  Nintendo needs to make Link's Awakening 2 or I'll get really mad.<BR>
<LI> What the heck is he?-A human or an elf.  Or both?<BR>
</UL>

<B>Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Saved hyrule.  Multiple times.  Good for him.<BR>
<LI> Singlehandily killed off Marin and the rest of Koholint island without even knowning it.  What a loser.<BR>
<LI> Um...fends off puberty to sound link a girl until he's 30.  Okokok, I'll stop the Link bashing.<BR>
<LI> Link's Adventure.  Thats a nice game, but not many people have played it.<BR>
</UL>

<B>Why People Like Link:</B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI> Sword Skills-Who doesn't want to be a Blademaster?<BR>
<LI> The Adventure-Link games offer a nice mix of RPGness and Adventureness.  Coolness.<BR>
<LI> I don't know.  The question should be, why WOULDN'T anyone like link?<BR>
</UL>
