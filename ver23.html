<H3> By Sean King </H3> </CENTER><BR>
(Note:The early part of the bio takes place whith the Great  Reptile Wars)<BR>
<P>
Back in 80 b.c.,an egg was layed during the Great Reptile Wars,when<BR>
dinosaurs and Dragons went to war.Worried about their child,the parents<BR>
preserved their egg underground.Then,in 1952 a.d., the egg hatched.His first<BR>
sight was Kamek,a 200 year old magikoopa asigned by the baby's parents to<BR>
raise him.He named him Bowser.(The next part has to do with the Mario<BR>
games.)<BR>
<P>
Afterwards,Bowser's house was ambushed by an army of dragons and mushroom<BR>
men.Capturing  Bowser,they took him to a large cannon,and placed him in.The<BR>
last thing he saw was a large familler dragon.<BR>
<P>
Bowser then headed back to the Mushroom Kingdom,and,when he made it to his<BR>
castle,he saw a creature he first heard about from Kamek....Dragoon,lead<BR>
general of the Dragons and murderer of Bowser's parents.The two fought,and<BR>
Bowser managed to kick Dragoon out of his castle.<BR>
<P>
Althought,that wasn't Bowser's last encounter with Dragoon.......<BR>
<P>
                           TO BE CONTINUED......<BR>
<P>
                     Bowser Bio PART 2<BR>
Okay,where was I,oh yes,Bowser just defeated Dragoon(end of my game Bowser<BR>
Land.)Now for 6 months no one saw Dragoon.Then terrible news broke out:Evil<BR>
characters from all over attacked major areas of the Mushroom<BR>
World!Bowser,although not the evil type,decides to stop them,for he believes<BR>
Dragoon is tied with the attacks.Sure enough,he was.Bowser defeated him in<BR>
Dragoon's   underground  lair.Then,3 months later,Dragoon shows his true<BR>
intentions and ambushed the Mushroom Kingdom!Mario,realizing he's done a<BR>
terrible thing working with Dragoon and teams up with Bowser.In the<BR>
end,Dragoon is electricuted.Bowser and Mario break up the truse and become<BR>
enemies again.<BR>
<P>
What Bowser is up to today is unknown,but apparently he may be preparing for<BR>
Super Mario 64 2(is it really gonna be made or is it a rumor???!!!!)Until<BR>
then,well,who knows!<BR>
<P>
                                  THE END,OR IS IT?<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Thoughts From Jay</B> <BR><BR>
Wow, Bowser and Kamek are old.  What do you know, a viewer bio/game idea cross over.  I like this twist on Bowser’s life.<BR>
