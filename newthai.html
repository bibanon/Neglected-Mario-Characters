<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Thaimut </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  Pokemon Master Luigi<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Thaimut<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Unknown (It's a Pokemon)<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Unknown<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Luigi (It's trainer), Link, Ness, and Pikachu<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Mario, Toad, Bowser, the Koopa kids, the list goes on.<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Normally good.  Sometimes it can get pretty mean.<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Thaimut looks like a cross between a Charmeleon and a velociraptor.  It's black, stands on it's hind legs, is 10 feet tall, and has a velociraptor-like head and tail.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Thaimut was first discovered by Ness, who shortly later got mauled by it.  Luigi caught it (and saved Ness) and it's now his second favorite Pokemon to use in battle (the first being his first Pokemon, Pikachu).  It has mauled Ness, Mario 5 times, Toad twice, and Gary's Alakazam.  It has almost mauled Peach, Link, Luigi, Ness another time, Mario a sixth time, and Wario.  Getting this thing mad is a bigger mistake then angering Mewtwo.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Smash Bros. the RPG (this one is made up)<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Safely inside Luigi's Star Ball (a type of Poke'ball that's stronger than a Master Ball and uses Star Power to keep the Pokemon inside)<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Yes, Thaimut can evolve.  It is an evolved Pokemon.  It refuses to evolve again.  How do we know about it's evolution chain?  Link found a wierd egg and gave it to Luigi.  I hatched, revealing Thaimut's unevolved form, Lich.  As this creature evolved, to Kary, then Kracken, when it evolved another time, it became a Thaimut!  A week later, this Thaimut snatched a 'Rare Candy' off Luigi's desk then evolved into Chaos!  The final time it evolved is when it got too close to a batch of Grass, Fire, Thunder, and Moon stones.<BR>
