his hair like a good little boy.  Then he beats up Mario,
and ocassionally (*cough* All the time *cough*) gets beat
up.  His hatred of Mario's source is the fact that Mario
killed his mother's father's daughter's son's cousin's
uncle's neice's aunt's nephew's brother's sister's
colleges's roommate's second cousin's boss's best friend!

Megamash, Megamash, Megamash.  How he gets beat up by
Mario:  His only attack is the Mega Mash.  Unfortuantely
for this midget, his mash is an ant's sneeze.  Too bad.<BR>
