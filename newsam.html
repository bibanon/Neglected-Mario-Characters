<B>Description of looks:</B>  He looks like a slightly-larger-than-average Ninji from SMB2, but with a red headband above his eyes (which, I believe, he stole from Fighter Kirby in Kirby's Super Star)<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Samurai was born in Starborn Valley, where Ninjis take care of the Star Kids before they ascend to Star Haven.  This peaceful life didn't suit Samurai and he ran off to warmer climates.  On a journey in Toad Town Tunnels, he came across a sword (similar-looking to SSBM's Beam Sword) that granted ultimate victory to whoever wields it, in exchange for the last decade of their life.  Since Ninjis live to be over 500 (unless they're killed by plumbers), Samurai didn't see any reason not to take it.  15 minutes later, Samurai came across The Tubby One himself!  Mario!  The fiend responsible for the death of Samurai's father, Joshua!  With the Cursed Sword in hand, Samurai challenged Mario and took him down in 30 seconds.  He tore off Mario's sleeves and fashioned a headband (Now you know why Mario has short sleeves in Super Mario Sunshine).  Samurai has since appeared as a behind-the-scenes man and stunt double for many NCs.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Paper Mario<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Playing Pocket Tanks on a laptop he stole from my neighbor<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Samurai fights for good--only when the pay is good.  If one side offers him nicer stuff, then he fights on that side.  If the tide turns in battle, Samurai defects to the other side.  Of course, he could just lay out both sides with his sword, then take their stuff.<BR>
