<B>Description of looks:</B>  A large huge bulky turtle, with spikes all over his shell.  The shell's green and the underbelly's yellow, and the rest of his scales are dark orange.  He has long flowing hair growing from between his horns, and a small mustache grows from under his nostrils.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Historic researches have shown that this particular ancestor of Bowser's was the one who brought the Koopa Army to the fame it knows now.  What used to be a single overly aggressive tribe got turned into an unstoppable army and through several epic victories, it prospered to the fearsome empire that is in constant war with the Mushrooms.  Lord Artefact was a feared leader and started the trend of "capturing the enemy ruler's first underling to win his surrender".  He finally invaded the Mushroom Kingdom, but was killed by a band of Mushroom rebels who overthrew his reign and reclaimed the kingdom, swearing that it would become imprevious to the rotten Koopa troops again.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Mushrooms and Koopas, Mushroom Wars 2: Fallen Empires<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Rotting in Hell since 13 generations.  His grave is said to be under the ruins of his own palace, which is said to be buried beneath the current Koopa Keep.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Heh, I guess so few has been said about Bowser's ancestry so far.  I often wondered since how long the war between Mushrooms and Koopas might have lasted before Mario and Luigi, and wanted to create a few heroes to give it more epic proportions.  Artefact is one of those big names in the war.<BR>
