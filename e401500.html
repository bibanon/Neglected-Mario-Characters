Blooper)  Who's this Phillip dude, anyway?  I have several dozen of said screwdrivers in my basement....Wait a second, is it just me, or is your name 'dozen' with the 'n' and the 'z' switched....and isn't N-Z a bad guy in Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards?  Also, not to get off topic, but how come Tweeters haven't appeared in a video game since Super Mario Bros. 2?  Not to mention Bugzzys (like Fred), since Kirby's Adventure.  And, speaking of Kirby, I had him copy Citrus Man in my deathmatch (Deathmatch #15, Dr. Mario VS. Mario VS. Citrus Man) and created Citrus Marshmallow; is this copyright infringement or something?  And, furthermore, I....::Donez snores::....Oh, sorry.  I must be boring you, like that guy in Airplane!  Ever see that?  Anyway I'll shut up now.  Don't bother to answer my questions, I'll force Jay to do it.  Thanks.<BR>

Question 423: Hey Dr. D, In one of the more recent NC Comix, Kyle left SMBHQ; Did this REALLY happen, or was it just for the comic? And what on earth did Superman have to do with it? That was pointless, unless Kyle's a Superman Fan.<BR>
