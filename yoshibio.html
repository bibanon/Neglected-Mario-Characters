	The Yoshis are a race of Dinosaurs that live on Yoshi's Island of Dinosaur Land (The setting of SMW).  They were a peaceful race at the beginning.  Their government was fair and simple.  They took nice walks, ate berries, and munched on snacks.  The Yoshis lived a simple life where nothing different ever happened.  They took life as it was and had no worries (and no silly songs about goofy phrases like Hakuna Matata). One day though, brought something different to the life of the Yoshi's. A strange baby fell from the sky and landed in there little village.  The Yoshis had no idea what was going on. They had never before encountered anything of the type.  It took the leadership and courage of one green Yoshi, named Yoshi (or Yoshi the Great to ease confusion in this text), to figure out what to do.  He knew this baby possessed something special, and it was their job as Yoshis to find out.  So he gathered some of his multicolored friends, and set off on a journey to solve the mystery of the baby with the red cap.  The Yoshis were great warriors, using many weapons (like their unborn embryos -Kyle) in battle.  Their speed and agility was at the top of the list.  They later learned to throw their eggs and eat enemies using their tongues.  The Yoshis later learned that a powerful force had come over their land, named Bowser.  The Yoshis were first reluctant, and wanted to turn back, but Yoshi the Great stepped in and lead them all the way.  Yoshi was able to overcome Bowser and his mentor Kamek.  He also solved the red capped baby by finding his brother and sending the stork to his destination.  Things were peaceful again in Dinosaur World. <BR> <BR>
	Many years later, however, the Yoshis were facing the same battle again.  Bowser the Mean, had risen again in Dinosaur World just as mysteriously as he did the first time.  This time however, he had knowledge of the Yoshis ability to fight.  So they would not spoil his plot again, he used his power to trap the Yoshis in their eggs.  Yoshi the Great tried all he could, but it was no use, he was turned into an egg also.  Then Mario the red capped appeared again.  He found the shell of Yoshi the Great, and freed Yoshi the great from his prison.  Yoshi the Great gave his thanks, then realized that this was the same human that before fell into Dinosaur World.  Yoshi also realized that this human could help save his friends, and his country from Bowser.  So he told Mario the problem (who was still stunned by the fact that a six foot dinosaur was standing in front of him.) and together they saved Yoshi the Great's friends, and once again defeated Bowser as a treat to Dinosaur World. <BR><BR>
	Yoshi has followed Mario ever since, appearing (shortly) in games like Super Mario 64 and Super Mario RPG.  He's had a few small title roles too, like Yoshi's Cookie, Yoshi's Safari, and the aptly named Yoshi. He has also had his own adventures like his battle against Bowser in Yoshi's Story.  Yoshi is a Mario Universe legend, who will live on forever. <BR><BR>
	Wait a minute, there is still one thing that bothers me, do the Yoshis have different genders???  They do have male and female roles, RIGHT???  I, Jay Resop I, will again go through the depths of Nintendo to find Yoshi's gender type.  First I believed he was male, for he had many distinguishable Male qualities.  Then I realized the Yoshi laid eggs.  That's a female quality of any species of dinosaur.  So my answer: I have no answer.  All the Yoshis have to identify themselves so far is color.  Does a blue color indicate boy and pink indicate girl?  I think not, but if so, what's green?  They only have one word in their language-Yoshi, except our Yoshi speaks good English (sometimes even better then me.).  So unless I have missed an important fact in some game, which I may for it is late and I am tired, there is no answer.  So I'm asking you, the view to send me your ideas and beliefs on this subject at EWJim4@aol.com.  What do you think??? <BR><BR>

Also, I will be postponing any Kong Bio for it is a touchy subject and there are conflicting views on which game Donkey Kong has been in.  Although I find it quite simple to say DK was all of his games.-Jay<BR><BR>

Sorry, one more thing-one major eror I made in one of my NC's I would like to correct.  In my Donkey Kong NC I said he was replaced in SMK 64 by Wario, I realized this was not true moments after it was but up, but I kept forgetting to correct it.  Sorry, but it was Koopa Troopa who was replaced.-Jay
