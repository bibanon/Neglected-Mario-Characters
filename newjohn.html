<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Poser does not have much of a life.  He was born for one purpose: to be an announcer for the Neglected Character Deathmatch.  He lived in a small town in New Hampshire for the first 20 so years of his life.  Nothing much happened, his life is too boring to go into detail here.  But one day he was sucked into the internet by the webmaster of Neglected Characters and was forced to be an announcer for the Deathmatch.  Poser accepted mainly because he thought the whole thing was a dream to begin with and plus he had a lifetime grudge against Mario.  The webmaster had a simular view as Poser in that they both believed that the other characters in the Mario World deserved some credit for their work.  So far he has been doing a pritty good job as NC Deathmatch Announcer, but only time will tell his fate.<BR>
