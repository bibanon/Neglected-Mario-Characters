Question 31: Why do women have a pair of panties, but only one bra?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I bet this one is all Yoshinator's fault. But if not, my only guess is that women are just weird like that. Hey, us Doctors don't get many dates. What do we know about girls? <BR><BR>

Dr. Donez's Answer: Sure, I don't see why not. You don't eat bugs, do you? Thats usually what Fred's problem is when he trying to get a date. Although you may want to reread my answer to Question 31 about how little I know about women. Maybe they like to eat bugs. <BR><BR>
Question 34: Is it Scooby-Dooby-Doo or Sacobie-Dacobie-Dah?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Sacobie-Dacobie-Dah is French for "We don't have no more cheeze!" So I guess it depends on what "it" is.<BR><BR>
