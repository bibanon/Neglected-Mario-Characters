          A long time ago in the Mushroom World there was a species of
Koopas known as Lakitus. The word Lakitu means "creature of the clouds."
The Lakitus got there name by flying around in clouds and dropping
things on people. But the weird is that they`re all near sighted.
Kamek saw  these marvelous creatures and decided to use them in Bowser`s
army. These creatures fought the Yoshis twice, but loss both times (YI,
YS). After the second time the , the great race of Lakitus died out. Years
later, a Koopa Troopa was born. But this koopa`s shell looked a little
bit different then the other Koopa shells. This Koopa was also
near-sighted. So his parents named him Lakitu. Lakitu wasn`t like the
other Koopas, he wasn`t evil. So one day he decided to run away. He
didn`t take many things, only a camera, a street light, a fishing pole,
and 25 cents. While he was walking, he saw an old Mushroom  person with
a cloud. The Mushroom person sold thing Lakitu the cloud for 25 cents. Lakitu
rode the cloud to the Mushroom Kingdom. On his way, other Koopas saw
him. They found thetre own clouds and copied him, but they were evil.
They dropped spiny turtles on the Mushroom people. And thus the great
race of Lakitus were reborn. Bowser used Lakitus in his army and
still does. Then one day Princess Peach was captured by Bowser. Then the
Mario Bros. came to the Kingdom. They saved the princess. After a couple
of years, Lakitu  came tro the Mushroom Kingdom. The princess was scared
at first, but then Lakitu told her his story. Soon the princess had an
idea. She was going to hold annual go-kart races, and Lakitu could help
her. So Lakitu used his street  light and fishing pole in the races.
Years went by, and Princess Peach was captured by Bowser again. So Mario
went to save her. But thjis time Lakitu and his brother video taped the
entire adventure. After Mario saved the princess, the races were held
again. Lakitu helped again, but this time he had a fancy sign that told
the drivers thatr they were going in the wrong direction ( last time he
just had a piece of cloth with an X on it). After that, Lakitu bought a
house in the Mushroom Kingdom, where he now happily lives.
          THE END

OK...a more detailed discription of any generic character I could come up with.  Good job.
