<B>Description of looks:</B>  A giant fighter fly.  Has a crazy facial expression, and drool hanging from his lip.  Has an olive wreath on his
	head, ala a degenerate Roman emperor.  Has a cape, and boxing gloves.
<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Maniacal leader of Larvae Lake.  Rules over the maggots, who grow up to be flies.  Is generally recognized as
	the most disgusting, vile, shallow, irrational vermin in the world, and proud of it.
<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Wario RPG<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  N/A<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  The exact opposite of Frogfucious, not merely in race, but in personality.  Is based on the maniacal Roman
	Emperor, Caligula, who was known for his disgusting feasts and erratic behavior.  Many considered him to be
	insane.  He devours rotting carcass cake as Frogfucious dined on cricket pies.  Raises his maggots to be
	disgusting and uninhibited.  Terrible at giving insights, but throws a great party.<BR>
