Race: Monkies (duhhh)<BR>
gender: male or female<BR>

    On Yoshi's Island years ago there were monkies living there.  They were having fun there.  Then one day Yoshi brought a annoying little baby name Mario.  Evil little Mario(through the monkies eyes) cried alot.  So the monkies tried to still him.  Yoshi whos not nice, stoped the monkies.  Poochie really liked the monkies, even though he liked Yoshi.  The monkies want to get rid of eviel Mario, they think they will someday.<BR>

<B>Mushroom Land By,  Brian W.</B><BR>

Age: 10 kazillion years<BR>
First plant to evolve: Mushroom<BR>

And the Great Mushroom God said let their be fungus.  All of the sudden the new world was covered was covered in fungus it took so long for the mushrooms to evlove the Great Mushroom God just uprooted them and made them come to life then he left.  After that the Mushrooms got real smart and started to make warp pipes.  When suddenly A whole lot of people came and Divvied then mushroom land into kingdoms.  The way the people conquered the mushrooms so fast was they threanted to eat them if they didn't let the humans.  One of the Humans was kind and named the greatest Kingdom after the mushrooms.  Thus was Mushroom Kingdom.  Long After that the Kingdom was being conquered by an evil tyrant named King Morton Koopa (Bowser's father) it took the best warp pipe builders to build warp pipes in time to pull out 2 champions.  One of the champion's name was Link who talked of adventures of time travling with a Master's Sword  in a world called Hyrule.  The other Champion's name is unknown.  He did make a distress Beacon to make a Hero from space come to help the third hero went by the name Meteoroid aka Sambas Aaron  Then all the sudden when the second hero was shot by a fire ball which was shot by King Morton Koopa.  The kid then turned into an angel and told everybody not to worry his destiny was to die and go to heaven as Kid Icraus.  In a rage Link started slashing every one of Morton's minions.  Samus was charging up a huge gun.  After Samus Charged up Link threw his sword.  At the exact same time Samus's blast and Link's sword hit  Morton who fell down and slowly and mumbled about his son taking revenge.  In a huge furry Link removed he sword and stabbed Morton as much as he could screaming horrible word in the Hyrlian language.  After there was no more pieces left of Morton Samus calmed Link and convinced him to stop slashing any goombas in site.  The next day there was a going away party for Samus and Link.  There was also a funeral For "Kid Icraus."  After Link went home Samus said good-bye and destroyed the portal that "Kid Icraus" came from.  Little did anyone know except one little Mushroom named Toad that there was one warp pipe that everyone had forgotten that led to a strange place called Earth Toad did not tell anyone because he knew that trouble would arise again.
