<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Athena was brought into the world as a science expirement to be a war machine.  Bowser spent much of his funds on genetic expirements trying to get the ultimate Pokèmon so he could crush the Mushroom Kingdom with ease.  When Athena was "born", Bowser took an immediate disliking to her just because he felt Nidoqueen were horribly weak.  She soon learned how all the other creations hated him and planned revenge.<BR>  One day, she launched a revolt and destroyed Bowser's Lab of Doom.  Bowser was outraged and ordered all creations to be destoryed.  A kind hearted Goomba who felt it was wrong led Athena, a Scyther named Ceres and a Nidoking named Brutus to a hidden door where they were freed.  Athena was soon found by the Mushroom people and taken to the castle and learned of Bowser's evil plans.   She felt her main purpose was to destroy Bowser until one day when she was sucked into a mysterious portal similar to the one that sucked Mario away days earlier and found herself face-to-face with BJ Hunnicut from M*A*S*H* who ordered her to save Link and Jason from Mallow who was about to beat the two into bloody pulp.<BR>
