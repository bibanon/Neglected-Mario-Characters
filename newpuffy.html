<CENTER> <H2> Lord Puffy Dinks </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  SciNsboy<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Lord Puffy Dinks<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Male Finger Deamon<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Primary Village, In the Digiworld<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Um... well, come to think of it, everyone who knows him really hates him. So, no comment.<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Everyone in the Mario World, except his infamous insider spies. (That he keeps telling me he has.)<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Really, Really, not nice.<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Imagine a small grey puffball. Now give it two, small, pointy black ears. Give it two, flat, small, pointy black feet, but only two, and stick them where his front legs should go. And a strap to his underside, and you've got LPD!<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  A fluke on Elecmon's part, this Finger Deamon started out as a DigiEgg. But it mutated into a Finger Deamon. A Finger Deamon is a creature that attaches itself to someones finger, and then controlls them. He has caused much trouble in the Mushroom Kingdom. For instance, in SMB, he was the guy who made Bowser kidnap Peach. He's been getting a bad rap from then on. He is so evil, he controlled Miyamoto, who has sense made Luigi neglected. He is actually controlling me right now. He has spies everwhere, and his goal is to take over the world, and get a bio posted for him.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  SMB, SMB 4: The Return of Dinks, Mario Tennis, Mario Kart, SM64, Lord Puffy Dinks: THE GAME, The game where Lord Puffy Dinks controlls SciNsboy, and Lord Puffy Dinks Takes Over The World.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Commanding me to start working on his big bio.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  I hope no one whips me for liking Digimon. Jay, despite Digireferrences, please let this go through. Oh, and to all you Poke'maniacs, ANY of the Digidestined could beat Ash. Anyday. Anywhere.<BR>
