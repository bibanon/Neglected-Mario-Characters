So he created Cloner. Cloner captured the princess, then cloned an army of Bowsers and together they captured Mario and Luigi. When Cloner was destroying them Toad appeared out of nowhere and tried to save Mario and the gang and nearly failed. Toad forgot his mushrooms and he did bring was a chunk of old, smelly cheese. Crazily, he ate it. Suddenly, he gained super strength and clobbered Cloner and his army. Ahhhh! The power of cheese!!!<BR>
