<H2><CENTER> Puntin' Chuck vs. Hammer Brother </CENTER></H2><BR>
Poser: After a 5 year hiatus, we're finally back, Lyle!<br>
Orlando: So cccooold.... no heating for 5 years...<br>
<p>
<img src="dm1.PNG" align="left">
Poser: In the right corner, we have the inhuman football machine, Puntin' Chuck!<br>
Orlando: Brrr... And in the leftover corner, we have the hammer chuckin' madman, Hammer Brother!<br clear="all">
<img src="dm2.PNG" align="left">
Poser: It took us quite a while to locate Puntin' Chuck.<br>
Orlando: Turns out he has as many brothers as there are sports... and for some reason, he only can be found in the darkest caves...<br clear="all">

<img src="dm3.PNG" align="left">
Poser: And Hammer Brother's hammer goes... flying off into the distance!<br>
Orlando: But this opens him up to a kicked football! Just what was he thinking?<br clear="all">

<img src="dm4.PNG" align="left">
Poser: And Chargin' Chuck is unable to think of the right words!<br>
Orlando: Good thing he isn't on Don't Forget the Lyrics, or he would have lost right here!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm5.PNG" align="left"><br clear="all">
<img src="dm6.PNG" align="left"><br clear="all">

<img src="dm7.PNG" align="left">
Poser: Oooh, that's gotta hurt.<br>
Orlando: Or does it?<br clear="all">


<img src="dm8.PNG" align="left">
Poser: It looks like a landslide, Orlando! This match could be over right now!<br>
Orlando: I don't think so, Poser. He could always come back.<br clear="all">

<img src="dm9.PNG" align="left">
Poser: I didn't know footballs were flammable! Hammer Brother is doomed!<br>
Orlando: Hammer Brother will win! Fire will not stop him!<br clear="all"> 

<img src="dm10.PNG" align="left">
Poser: It's over, Orlando!<br>
Orlando: No it isn't! Hammer Brother will rise up from the ashes!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm11.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: Hammer Brother will triump--er... fine. I give up.<br>
Poser: ...While we're at it... what is Discoland?<br clear="all">

<img src="dm12.PNG" align="left">
Poser: Wait a minute, what's that?<br clear="all">
<img src="dm13.PNG" align="left">
Orlando: I told you so!<br clear="all">

<img src="dm14.PNG" align="left">
Poser: But who wins now?<br>
Orlando: Well, Hammer Brother was defeated before the end, and his hammer stayed in play. Chargin' Chuck was declared a winner but then was defeated moments afterwards...<br clear="all">
<img src="dm15.PNG" align="left">Poser: This should do...<br>
Orlando: Woo! I'll be able to afford hot meals again!<br clear="all">
Poser: Thanks for watching the first Deathmatch in years, NC fans. Don't worry--more Deathmatches will come in the future!<br>
