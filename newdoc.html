<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Who knows, he's just psychotic.<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Have you played Kirby's Dreamland 2 and fought the second form of Dark Matter? Thats the basic Idea. If not, he's this big black flying one-eyed blob with smoke coming out the back.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Because he was insulted about his looks, Rufus went crazy and decided to try to take over Cyooba with powerful Magic and Mario clones.  He failed and was exiled to Mario world.  He made himself a huge maze-like castle and is planning to destroy Fred (Cyoobans hate Spanyards).<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Plotting to take over Mushroom World with Wart and Luigi.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Please try to somehow put this guy into comix or deathmatches.  He would make a great rival for Fred.  And give credit to Jackal Lord.  Thank You<BR>
