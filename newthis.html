<CENTER> <H2> Princess Thistle Mildew </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  Ditto McCloaker<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Princess Thistle Mildew<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Female<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Washroom Kingdom<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Wario, Waluigi, Boshi, Stool, Cap'n Syrup<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Princess Peach Toadstool, Princess Daisy<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Neutral, like Wario.  Not quite evil.<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Taller and thinner than Peach, with pale white skin, she is beautiful, though in a very sinister sort of way.  She has large, intense green eyes, a thin nose, black lips, and pointy ears.  Her red hair starts in a pointy 'v' at her forehead, and is much like Princess Peach's, above the shoulderline  which deviates below, as it becomes outrageously spiky and jagged, like a pineapple.  She wears a long, lowcut, cactus-green dress, with a jagged yellow hemline, and a red brooch on her chest etched with a frowny face.  She wears long black gloves and is usually seen with a cigarette in a holder, though it is unknown whether she smokes.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Despite being the wealthy Princess of the Washroom Kingdom, Princess Mildew is very dissatisfied with her life.  Intensely vain and self-indulgent, she ignores the complaints of her disgruntled citizens, having left her dismal Kingdom to go completely to pot.  She has been extremely envious of Princess Peach and Princess Daisy since her days at Boarding School, because of their popularity and lovely kingdoms.  She is also supposedly the sister of Captain Syrup Mildew, who, not altogether shockingly, denounced the Washroom Kingdom throne for a life on the high seas as the head of the Brown Sugar Pirates.  In addition, it is rumored she is secretly infatuated with one of the Wario Brothers, though they are both either ignorant or apathetic of her interest.  This may be because of her envy of the attention the hated Peach and Daisy receive, as she constantly concocts dangerous situations as a way of getting Wario or Waluigi to save her, though such attempts often end in the frustrated Princess having to get their attention via the lure of some additional treasure and/or monetary reward.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Wario Land 1,2,3 or 4; Wario Brothers; Mushroom Kingdom Chronicles; Mario Tennis; Bowser's Seige Story; and Wario RPG:  Legend of the Seven Locks<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  In her palace, devising ways to get the Wario Brothers' attention.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  -"Stool, you cretin!  You call this a toe massage?!"<BR>
 
-"Dear Wario:  I am being held in the treasure room of a large, well-furnished castle full of priceless valuables, owned by a wealthy thief.  Please resuce me."<BR>
 
-"Why can I not get the admiration I deserve?"<BR>
