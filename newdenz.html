<B>Description of looks:</B>  Denzenello is skinny but his body is not quite as weak as one
would think (Bowser's trying to get him to to work out more often). His hair
is long and somewhat wavy. His eyes are a startlingly bright brown( Almost a
tannish hue). Wears a pair of dark black pants, Black boots, Navy blue
shirt, and and a black trenchcoat.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  There in a reason that Bowser has Magick users(the Magikoopas) in his army.
This story begins with a tear in the fabric of Timespace, similar to the one
that brought the Marios to the Mushroom world. A young boy was hurtled
through this rip, which connected the Gaian Dimension (Where most humans
exist) and the Mushroom Dimension. This boy was Dennis Zendell, a teenager
with powerful magick. Dennis ended up on Dinosaur World ( Where the Yoshies
live) at about the time that King Bowser was building his troops on the
small planet, preparing for an interplanetary war with the Mushroom world.
Dennis was found unconscious by Bowser's forces and taken to the main
castle. He was then put into a dungeon cell where he waited for
interrogation, by Bowser himself. When he finally woke up, he was quite
scared (Just the way Bowser likes his victims), but he quickly formed a
plan. The following discussion ensued:<BR>

Dennis : Where am I? Who are you?<BR>

Bowser : I WILL ASK THE QUESTIONS HERE!!!!!! What is your name and how did
you get to the dinosaur world?<BR>

Dennis :............. You may call me........ Denzenello. I came here, not
of my own will by way of some sort of rip in the fabric of timespace. This
is " Dinosaur world " ?<BR>

Bowser : Yes, I just said that.<BR>

Denzenello : Are you by any chance the one known as King Bowser?<BR>

Bowser : ?!?........... How did you know that?<BR>

Denzenello : Is there a mushroom world with two pesky plumber and a
beautiful princess?<BR>

Bowser : How have you learned all of this? Are you a spy of some sort?<BR>

Denzenello : Oh no no no....... I have seen your battle with the plumbers
and I know just how bad you have been beaten by them.<BR>

Bowser : I wasn't beaten THAT bad.....<BR>

Denzenello : Yes of course............. Perhaps what you need is a new type
of soldier.<BR>

Bowser : Why I oughtta..............? What type of soldier?<BR>

Denzenello : A soldier that uses magick. A magikoopa.<BR>

Bowser : Hmm......  I like the idea. How will we go about training these
soldiers.<BR>

Denzenello : Leave that to me I am a powerful mage and I am able to teach
the art of magick to some of your troops. It will be a long strenuous task
and success, for most is unlikely but I will do my best to serve you. I,
too, wish to finally defeat those bothersome plumbers.<BR>

Thus Dennis, now called Denzenello, fights alongside Bowser in a heated
attempt to finally defeat Bowser and control the world. Though Denzenello
says that he's loyal to Bowser, his actions are still unclear and it is
often difficult to determine who's side he's really on.

<B>Currently:</B>  <BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Denzenello is extremly smart and crafty. You never see him
attack the Mario Bros. directly, preferring to use his magick from a
distance and sending the Magikoopas to deal with him.<BR>

way.<BR>
