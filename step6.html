Now that you've gotten you're pictures made, it's time to finish the job.  Open up Notepad and type in the following code:<BR>
&#60;HTML&#62;<BR>
&#60;HEAD&#62;<BR>
  &#60;TITLE&#62;My Comic&#60;/TITLE&#62;<BR>
&#60;/HEAD&#62;<BR>
&#60;BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"&#62;<BR>
&#60;P&#62;<BR>
&#60;BR&#62;<BR>
&#60;IMG SRC= "CY_XX.gif"&#62;&#60;BR&#62;<BR>
&#60;IMG SRC= "CY_XX.gif"&#62;&#60;BR&#62; is the only code you have to type multiple times.<BR>
Replace Y with the comic number and XX with the frame number. Make sure to change XX to whatever number the frames are.  For example, on your first comic you have frames 1 and 2.  On one you'd put "C1_01.gif" and on the next you'd put "C2_02.gif".  Save it as "Comic1.htm" after you've finished putting in all the frames.  Open it and vìola!  Your comic is now complete!  Now journey foward and see if you can uncover all the advanced techniques, short-cuts, and comic content of the Comic-Making World!<BR>
