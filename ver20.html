<P>
Long ago a man name Boomer, was electrocuted. He became half red and half<BR>
blue.  He switched colors.  A evil man name Smithy liked that so he put<BR>
him in Bowser’s Keep.<BR>
<P>
Boomer guarded the chandeliers.  One day Mario, Mallow, Bowser, Geno, and<BR>
Toadstool found him and fought against him.  He lost, but he couldn’t admit<BR>
it.  He fell off the chandelier, and he got rescued by a bunch of shy guys.<BR>
 Then he decided to start his own game called Boomer's revenge.  He made<BR>
lots of money.  He then relaxed he must defeat Mario, But that’s another<BR>
story.<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Thoughts From Jay</B> <BR><BR>
Um, a nice small bio.  Short, but original and cool.  I’d like to learn more about Boomer, maybe we’ll see more from Mario Bug.<BR>
