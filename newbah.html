<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Bahumut is often confused for a Pokemon.  He's not one.  When he and Luigi met, he tried to turn Luigi into a frog with a magical staff he carries around.  It failed because Ness (a good friend of Luigi's who was with him at the time) used PSI to reflect the spell back at Bahumut (The spell wore off in about an hour).  Now, Bahumut hangs around the castle stealing Peach's necklaces.<BR>
