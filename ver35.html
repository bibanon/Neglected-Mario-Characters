 Well it all started from the family of powerful [mechanic rulers] named
the Smiths. They were powerful but the cluthes of the Star Raod
wouldn't give them Freedom to do evil. One day Frithy and Grithy had the
son named Smithy. Frithy though him how to rule Exor and learn computer
technoligy. Grithy on the other hand is a living nightmare. She makes
kids do all the chores and over 100 loads of dirty clothes a day. When
you over 100 years in Smith years your are an adult. Smithy known of the
Star Road and known of the Smith keeping them away. Though somehow
Smithy was extermely powerful and used Exor to break the Star Road. He
also used Bowser's keep [Castle] as his base. As all of you may know
about Bowser in SMRPG was extermely ANGRY! ALthough he did know that his
team [no offense to you Bowser fans] was no match for the Smithy Gang.
Though he also didn't know about Geno nethier that it grants wishes. HE
decided to gather tham all up and destroy them and get anybody to join
Smithy as he could. Smithy failed but he now has more pwer than ever.
Though it is a living nightmare still when Grithy visits. Though his
grandmother Writhy was even worse. I have a mystery about Grithy at
http://www.angelfire.com/id/smitcroc/rpg.html and as some of you may
know about Croco and me at SMRPG Super Spot! But back to Smithy anyhow.
Smithy attacked Busber any of you know about Busby the bobcat? I have a
friend that is a fan of him. Smithy rarely showed his trueform of power.
Usually used his true power incase he was in very hard fight for him.
Like when Mario, Mallow, Geno, yes even Bowser, and Princess Toadstool
with some help from the stars they collected and weaponary and armory
and so on to help them. They saved the WHOLE world [not just the Town].
THough Bowser still attacked in Mario 64 but that is for a Bowser bio.
Planning to get all of MArio's foes Bowser, Wart, Wario, Tanganga,
Donkey Kong, and Kamek [The leader of the Magikoopas and who raised up
Bowser and has his Magikoopas and himself to help him out]. Though he
has territories around the galaxy and his now extremely powerful. When
will he pull his attack on Mushroom Kingdom World [If I say world I mean
the hole world of Mario] Well you'll just have to wait for Nintendo to
give Smithy a game.
