<B>Gender:</B>  Male and Female, respectively<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Italy<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Kamek and the Koopas<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Very good<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Genarro stood about 5'6".  Looked like the illustrations of Mario (or "Jumpman") on
	the original Donkey Kong arcade game.  (I figure this is how Mario looked before 	Miyamoto
	started giving him "face lifts."  Since Mario probably looked like his dad, this is a good way to 	imagine him.)  Short, burly, (not manga-style).  Plaid hat and shirt, red overalls.  Short sleeves,
	 burly arms.  Brown hair and brown eyes.  An more current image would be white hat and overalls, 	plaid shirt, white hair and mustache, little spectacles on his nose, scarf around his neck, and kindly 	features.  Petunia was a ravishing beauty, looked sorta like Princess Peach, but with black hair, 	tied back, white dress, with a little apron with a flower on it.  Olive, Italian skin and green eyes		 (like Luigi).  About 6 feet, like Peach.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Italian couple.  Genarro was born in Florence, Petunia on a farm outside of Sicily.  They were
	married, and ambled around Italy in a caravan until they met Vittorio, who took them to the
	Mushroom World, where they crusaded against Kamek.  They gave birth to Mario and Luigi,
	whom they later gave to Vittorio to raise in the real world, safe from the Koopas.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Appeared at the end of SMW2:  Yoshi's Island.  Could also appear in:  Mario RPG 3- The
	Search for Mama and Papa; Super Mario Parents.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Present whereabouts and health status unknown.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Nintendo should tell more about Mario and Luigi's family.  Also, I know, the name Petunia has
	been used by another person writing a viewer bio.  I swear I am not stealing it.  I came up with
	the idea of Mario's parents and their names years ago.  It's a coincidence.<BR>
