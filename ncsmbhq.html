<B>Mario Games it has been in: </B><BR>
Well, I know it seems strange, but Kyle inspired me to do a NC on the SMBHQ when he quoted “That and me being in a few clubs means the page has to get neglected. “  So I thought...maybe I should add the SMBHQ to the Neglected Character List.  Lets see how it goes.<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Sadly, SMBHQ has not apeared in any Mario Games.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Mario Games it COULD of been in: </B><BR>
I’ll have to streach it a tad bit here...<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Super Mario Bros 2-That veggie machine...we put it there.  If you look really closely on some screens you can see the logo on the side of the turnups.<BR>
<LI> Super Mario Kart-Thats Kyle as Lakatu.  Really, I mean it.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Stories that need to be told: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>  IS Luigi EVER going to get his staring role???<BR>
<LI>  Why is it SO POPULAR!  80,000+ hits in a year!!!  Well, we know the answer to that...<BR>
<LI>  What is Jay Resop’s REAL NAME???<BR>
<LI>  WHY IS THE SMBHQ BEEN NEGLECTED???  Wait, that HAS been told.<BR>
<LI>  Why is that 1 in every 5 people that visit the SMBHQ suddenly vanish without a trace???<BR>
<LI>  When will the SMBHQ be recognized as one of the greatest pages of all time???  Soon I hope.
<LI>  WHY IS JAY RESOP SO PRESSESD ABOUT LUIGI???  You’ll never know.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Forgotten Heroism: </B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>  TONS OF INFORMATION!!!  When you think of all the stuff that has been put on this page from Kyle and the rest of the staff (Me, Adam and Mark) ITS A LOT!!!  And most of this was done by KYLE ALONE.  So when you’re out complaining about “Lack of updates”, LOOK AGAIN.  NEVER WILL YOU SEE THIS MUCH MARIO INFO IN ONE PLACE.  So stop being greedy.<BR>
<LI>  Started a year ago from August.  It was just a small Mario page that was started from nothing.  Then grew to the large success it is today.  I got my job as NC person ‘cause I new Kyle in middle school.  I can also be considered the “Co-Founder” of the page.  Although the page is all his idea, I helped him out with ideas and such.  Bet you didn’t know that.<BR>
<LI>  I think its sad that there are pages on the SMBHQ list that don’t have our link on theirs.<BR>
<LI>  OK, I don’t want to be mean, but regular updates have been pretty much forgotten.  But this is the reason why SMBHQ seems Neglected.<BR>
<LI>  Game Reviews.  I had fun doing them.  Kyle should bring them back.<BR>
</UL>
<B>Why People Like the SMBHQ:</B> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>  IT’S A COOL PAGE!!!-Info, Polls, News, Wierd Stuff.  Whats to hate?<BR>
<LI>  In the beginning, there was new stuff every week!-And when Kyle ran out of games to review, he did other stuff!  New things are always coming up on the SMBHQ.  Even now-a-days.
<LI>  New stuff never seen on the internet.-I bet there aren’t too many pages with as comprehensive sections on the Mario Cartoons and Comics.  I must say my NC idea is pretty original...<BR>
<LI>  Just a beautiful site-I’ve seen some pretty ugly sites of all kinds on the internet.  But the pictures, the outlook, the organization, and the sections of the SMBHQmake it truly one of the best.<BR>
<LI>  Well, the first one sums it up nicely, but I know you all love the Neglected Characters section...<BR>
