                                            Bowser was born 1000 years ago.<BR>
Because  his  parents were killed  by Buffy the Vampire Slayer(It makes the<BR>
story more interesting.)he lived with his uncle Kemeck.But he got tired of<BR>
living with his uncle Kemeck so he ran away.He found a pipe and fell into<BR>
it.The next thing he knew he was in a new world. Goombas and koopas were<BR>
running around the world in sworms.Bowser wandered around the world and met<BR>
Koopa the Quick. (Koopa the Quick is now his best friend)Bowser looked<BR>
around some more and found out that part of the world tiny and huge,some was<BR>
desert,some was battle fileld and some was meadows and mountains.Bowser<BR>
loved the new world so HE TOOK OVER!!!!One day Mario and Luigi came to<BR>
Bowser's world and started to cause mischif.Bowser did not like Mario and<BR>
Luigi so he fought them in combat.They beat him,but he persisted on and has<BR>
been beaten to this day.<BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B> <BR><BR>
Two Bowser bios in one week.  They both contradict each other, but who cares.  Great bios don’t like these don’t need to be worried about.<BR>
