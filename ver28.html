<P>
Dodo is a very fat bird. He has only one friend. Her name is Valentia.<BR>
From his birth to the wedding, here's a bio on Dodo:<BR>
Dodo was born in Land's End. He didn't like it there. He ran away from<BR>
home when he was ten. After a while he moved to Tadpole Pond. He was<BR>
still a normal bird then. Then Dodo was adopted by Frogfucious. His<BR>
favorite food was Cricket Pie. The bird could eat 64,000 in one day!<BR>
Therefore he is seriously overweight. He had one friend: Valentia. They<BR>
made evil plans together. About 15 years later they made another evil<BR>
plan. This one was to take over Nimbus Land. There Dodo was supposed to<BR>
pretend to be Prince Mallow. Being weak-minded fools, the Nimbus Landers<BR>
believed this. Now Dodo made Valentia his queen. Then Mario, Mallow and<BR>
Princess walk in. They defeat Dodo and Valentia. Dodo landed on a tower-<BR>
Booster's Tower, that is! Now Booster and Valentia are going to get<BR>
married. Dodo, finally noticing how overweight he is, decides to go on a<BR>
diet. He presently does not know which one. Sorry, Dodo, but I guess<BR>
you'll have to wait!<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Thoughts From Jay</B> <BR><BR>
Ok bio, but it could of used some more pep.  Add some wierd story on Dodo’s back life on how he came to the Mushroom World on a spaceship that was ment to go to Pluto.  Now thats a great story.<BR>
