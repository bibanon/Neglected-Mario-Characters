<P>
Once there were brothers named Harry and Jerry.  They both always got in<BR>
trouble at school because they would throw hammers.  In wood shop they<BR>
would throw hammers at the teacher even.  They dropped out.  Then one day<BR>
they met a dragon named Bowser, he said he'll let them join his club.  They<BR>
became loyal members of him.  <BR>
<P>
They met the Mario brothers.  They were very evil they thought. They<BR>
almost destroyed them but they didnt.  Then about 5 years later they met<BR>
them again.  They also were with the boomerang brothers and the fireball<BR>
brothers.  This time they were the sledge hammer brothers they tried to get<BR>
rid of Mario and Luigi but they couldnt.  Then 1 year later they became<BR>
workers on buldings and would come down beams and try to destroy Mario,<BR>
Luigi and Yoshi.  But they didnt.  Then a few years later they fought Mario<BR>
and accidently lost their hammer to him.  Then they challenged Mario to a<BR>
bunch of puzzles. Mario won though.  Where they are now is unkown.<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Thoughts From Jay</B> <BR><BR>
A bunch of puzzles???  Oh ya, Super MaRPGio.  Another bio on a character thats not realy a main character, but a common one.  Good job.<BR>
