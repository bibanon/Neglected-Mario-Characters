Merlon taught Nogamis for ten years, and then pronounced Nogamis as his own master.  Nogamis then hiked up to Shooting Star Summit in order to find inspiration.  He was met by Kamek, who was also training up there.  Kamek beat Nogamis down very badly that day, and said some very bad things about his mother.  Nogamis vowed to kill Kamek whatever it took from that day forth.
