"THAT’S IT!!!!" King Dad screamed at the top of his lungs. "You’ve 
failed countless times, I’m cutting your allowances."<BR><BR>
Later....<BR><BR>
"Cutting our allowances? Who does he think he is?" Roy asked.<BR>
"He’s gonna pay for this," I said.<BR>
"I have an idea," said Geek. "Remember Wart?"<BR>
("That’s LUDWIG!!!")<BR>
"Yeah, are you suggesting...," started Iggy.<BR>
"...we join him?" I finished.<BR>
"Yes," said Geek.<BR>
("My name is Ludwig, Lemming," says Ludwig.<BR>
"Who’s telling the story here? Why I believe it’s ME!!!!" Lemmy said.)<BR>
"So what do we do?" Larry asked Geek.<BR>
"We find the door to sub-con and release Wart," Geek replied.<BR>
("I’m not even going to try anymore.")<BR>
"How do we find the door?" asked Brat.<BR>
"Simple, with my new..." started Geek, "DREAM MACHINE!!! We simply place 
this on ones head and they will go into the land of sub-con. When they 
come out, they bring anything touching there hands with with them."<BR>
"Ingenious," said Larry.<BR>
"Of course it is," started Geek, "I’m Ludwig Von Koopa."<BR>
"We need a volunteer," said Wendy. "Count me out, I don’t wanna get 
warts from touching the frog."<BR>
"WEDDING CAKE!!!" yelled Moron.<BR>
"Uhhhh...." we all said.<BR>
"I’ll go," said Iggy, my twin.<BR>
"Not without me you aren’t," I said.<BR>
"So the twins are going," Geek said. "Hop in."<BR>
Iggy and I got into the machine. Suddenly we found ourselves in the land 
of sub-con that we’d only seen in shy guy’s pictures...<BR><BR>
