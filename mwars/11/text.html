Our spy, Mount N. Hill, rushed into the castle. "Luigi found the Crystal 
of Reststop!" he yelled.<BR>
"WHAT?!?!?!?!?" I screamed. "Everyone, letís go, itís time for WAR!!!!"<BR>
........................................................................<BR>
................................................................<BR>
We went to the warp pipe room. "Okay, hereís how weíll divide it. Iggy, 
Wendy, Larry, and I are going straight at the Mario Bros. and Peach," I 
said.<BR>
"Roy and Morton are coming with me to go defeat King Dad," Geek said.
("Didnít I say ÎDonít call me Geekí?"
"No, you said ÎMy name is Ludwig, not Geek.í"
"Grrr...")<BR>
We each took various troops and jumped down the warp pipes in the room. 
Geek and his troops jumped into a pipe marked "Bowserís Castles." My 
troops and I jumped down the pipe labled "Super Mario Bros. Headquartes" 
or "SMBHQ" for short. A few idiots jumped down a pipe marked "Kirby 
Headquarters" but we continued on. We saw a series of doors as we walked 
through. One was labeled "Fanfics" another "Cartoons", a third was 
labeled "Whatís New." We finally found a door marked "Characters" and 
went in. We was more doors. "Comix," "Deathmatches" "Name Game." We 
decided to walk into "Bios". THere were pictures of virtually every 
person in the world. I walked over to the picture of Peach and looked 
in. I signaled the troops to follow me. We walked in and saw the 
princess sitting down for tea with Mario, the fat load, and Luigi. There 
was silence as tea was being poured, and suddenly we heared the scream 
of my little sister, Wendy...<BR>
"ATTACK!!!!!!"<BR>
........................................................................<BR>
..................................................................<BR>

Meanwhile, Geekís troop was doing fine. "Okay, we donít want to go into 
the fanfic door or the game door...," he pondered.<BR>
"What about the mailroom? He might be there," Roy suggested.<BR>
"Okay, letís go there." They walked into the room and saw a series of 
doors with different dates. June 13 was the newest. There was one from 
febuary. He walked into the door marked "Current" seeing if that was 
were Bowser was. He saw King Dad writing letters with a Hyrulian being. <BR>
"On the count of three, we attack," said Geek. "Moron, start counting."<BR>
Moron started counting on his fingers. "One.... Two.... WEDDING CAKE!!!"<BR>
"He means...," Roy started, "THREE!!!!"<BR><BR>
