<TITLE>The Mushroom Wars</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >

We had created a few ingenious plans, all of them foolproof. <BR>
Unfortunatly, none mere Mortonproof, so we had to keep thinking.<BR>
"Weíve finished an extremely powerful robot, young prince," Robotnik 
told me. "But we are lacking the power to run it. We have no energy 
source powerful enough to charge it up."<BR>
"By any chance, Dr. Robotnik," Giovanni started, "can you make a 
backpack and a hole in the back for a large battery?"<BR>
"Of course, but where would we get one?"<BR>
"A pikachu, of course."<BR>
"Easier done than said," I said quickly, holding out a pikachu. <BR>
"See if you can hook him up to the robot, make sure the wires touch the 
red of his cheeks," Giovanni told Robotnik. Robotnik took the pikachu 
and ran off.<BR>
"Stupid human," Sigma said, "Canít even find a power source for his 
robot. I have tons of robots, all with internal generators."<BR>
"Good for you," I said, sarcastically. "Can you just get working?"<BR>
Sigma walked off as Wendy came up to me. "We have a slight problem," she 
said, very worried.<BR>
"Youíre macaroni didnít cook right?"<BR>
"No, it came out perfect. The problem is that I heard that Megaman, 
Crash Bandicoot, Sonic the hedgehog, and Ash Ketchum have come to defeat 
their arch enemies."<BR>
"Oh, not MORE heroes."<BR>
"And it gets worse. King Dad has joined forses with Lardioís brother in 
hopes of getting us back under his control. Their team is called ÎDual 
Alliance of Deathí or DAD for short."<BR>
("One question," Iggy said. "How did you know this?"<BR>
"I have spies," Wendy replied.<BR>
"Shutup so I can finish this story," Lemmy said.)<BR>
Meanwhile, somewhere between dimensions...<BR>
"Blue streak speeds by, Sonic the hedgehog," Sonic sang, running from 
the Sega world to the Nintendo world. He suddenly stopped short, seeing 
a large orange bandiccot. "What the heck are you?" he asked.<BR>
"I could ask you the same question," the bandicoot replied, "But Iím 
Crash Bandicoot, heading to the nintendo universe to stop Cortexís next 
evil scheme. Who are you?"<BR>
"Sonic the hedgehog," Sonic informed Crash. "And Iím on my way to stop 
Robotnik from his latest evil scheme in the land of Nintendo."<BR>
"Weird, two evil geniuses from two different places going to the same 
place."<BR>
Just then, a camera projected an image of Coco on the wall. "Crash," she 
said, "Cortex is in leauge with many other villans from across the 
universe. Proceed with caution or youíll be hopelessly outnumbered." The 
projection faded.<BR>
"Do you think theyíre working together?" Sonic asked the bandicoot.<BR>
"Probably. Letís go stop them."<BR>
Just then, Megaman showed up. "Hey, Crash, Sonic!" the blue robot 
screamed.<BR>
"Let me guess," Sonic started, "Sigma and Wiley have gone to the 
Nintendo world for evil schemes."<BR>
Megamanís mouth dropped. "How did you know?"<BR>
"All the villans did, thatís where weíre headed." The three set off 
together.<BR>
("How do you know this happened? You werenít there."<BR>
"Wendyís spies."<BR>
"Oh.")<BR>
Back at KHQ (Koopa Head Quarters)...<BR>
Knock knock! Someone was at the door. "Iíll get it," I yelled. I walked 
over to the door. Two humans, a male and a female, and their cat were 
there.<BR>
"To protect the world from devestation," the female started.<BR>
"To unite all peoples within our nation," the male said in response.<BR>
"To denounce the evils of truth and love," the female said, continuing 
the poem.<BR>
"To extend our reach to the stars above," the male said, reaching for 
the sky.<BR>
"JESSE!!!" the female shouted, getting into a strange pose. Appearantly 
that was her name.<BR>
"JAMES!!!" the male said, following her lead. He must be James.
"Team Rocket blast off at the speed of light, surrender now or prepare 
to fight," they yelled together.<BR>
"Meowth!" yelled the cat, "Thatís right."<BR>
"You must be here for Mr. Giovanni," I said. "Heís right over there." I 
pointed to the room he was in. They went off. "Strange poem," I said, 
"strange."<BR>
Wendy walked up to me again. "More news on DAD," she stated. "Theyíve 
closed down all the italian resteraunts to annoy Lardio."<BR>
"Hmm... that gives me an idea."<BR>
"What?"<BR>
"Do we still have our secret supply of pasta that you were saving for 
our dinner before you discovered that evil geniouses need brain food, 
like fish?"<BR>
"Of course. I havenít had time to use it."<BR>
"Hereís the plan, get the Koopa Kafe, our resteraunt, to have a special 
on pasta. We can get Mario to join our side that way, maybe, by tempting 
him with pasta."<BR>
"Good idea, then we can get the mushroom army. DAD will be helpless."
"And if our plan fails, we can kill him when he comes and have one less 
plumber to deal with."<BR>
"Perfect," Wendy said, "just perfect." We both laughed evilly for a LONG 
time.<BR><BR>
