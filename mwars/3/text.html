"How does Wart live here?" I asked myself. "Where are the lights?"<BR>
A shy guy then flipped a switch.<BR>
"Right here," he said, as the lights went on. "AHHHH!!! KOOPA!!!" He ran 
away into a mysterious door. Iggy and I decided to follow him. When we 
went into the door....<BR>
"KABOOM!!!" said a giant mouse. He threw a bob-omb at us. We dodged out 
of the way just before it exploded.<BR>
"What the?!?!?!?" I then threw a ball at him. He didn’t even flinch. He 
kept throwing bob-ombs.<BR>
"Yipes!!!" yelled Iggy, barely dodging a bob-omb. "Cover me!!" <BR>
I did as he asked knocking bob-ombs away from him and diverting the 
mouse’s attention to me. Iggy was rapidly looking through the official 
Super Mario Bros. 2 strategy guide. <BR>
"It says here," he started, "that we need to throw the bob-ombs back at 
him."<BR>
"Let’s do it." I started throwing the bob-ombs at him as they came to 
me. The mouse started getting hurt.<BR>
"Don’t.... you know... who I.... am...?" he asked. "I... am mouser.... 
minion of Wart...." He fell over. I mean FELL. He plopped down like a 
sack of tomatoes. <BR>
("You mean potatoes," Ludwig said."<BR>
"Shutup," Lemmy said.)<BR>
A mysterious door suddenly appeared. We went through it and saw a hydra. 
You know, those three headed snake things. "I suppose you’re snaker," 
Iggy said to him.<BR>
"I am Tri-clyde," the hydra said, "and you shouldn’t be here."<BR>
"We request to talk to Wart," I found myself bravely saying.<BR>
"Let me think," Tri-clyde said. "Hmmmm... NO!!!" He started breathing 
fire at us.<BR>
"YIPES!!! FIRE!!!" I screamed. Then I noticed some mushroom blocks.<BR>
("YOU noticed?" asked Iggy.<BR>
"Okay, that Iggy noticed them.")<BR>
We started stacking up the blocks to block the fire, then Iggy looked 
back in the guide book. "It says we should throw the mushroom blocks at 
him."<BR>
"Check," I said. We started throwing mushroom blocks. Problem was, with 
every throw we lost some of our sheild. We had trown three and hit him 
twice. We only had two left. <BR>
We threw one. It was heading straight towards him. We thought it was 
gonna kill him but....<BR>
"What the heck?" Iggy yelled. "We MISSED?"<BR>
"I dont know, but we gotta get him now," I replied.<BR>
"No one hurtsssss me," said Tri-clyde.<BR>
We had one block left this one was for all the marbles. We threw. We 
MISSED?!?!?<BR>
"We’re out of blocks!!! We’re gonna die!!" Iggy screamed like a girl.<BR>
"Not yet," I said. I took out one of my faithful star balls. I threw it 
straight at Try-clyde. I hit him right between the eyes on his middle 
head. He fell over and died.<BR>
"You haven’t sssssseen the lassssst of meeeee...." he said, while dying.<BR>
Another mysterious door appeared and we went in. This time we say a 
giant crab.<BR>
"A kingler!!! I’m gonna catch it!" I yelled.<BR>
"This is SMB2, not POKÈMON, Lemmy," my twin calmly told me.<BR>
"Ohhhh."<BR>
"Who are you and what do you want?" the crab asked.<BR>
"We are Lemmy and Iggy Koopa and we demand to see Wart," I boldly told 
him.<BR>
"You mean Iggy and Lemmy," Iggy tried to correct me.<BR>
"Let me think. Hmmmmmm. NO!!!!" the crab nearly screamed in my ear. 
Wait, I don’t have ears. He started throwing boulders at us. Iggy looked 
back in the guide. I started throwing them back at him.<BR>
"It says throw them back at him," Iggy said.<BR>
"No. Really?" I said sarcastically. This crab was wicked easy. He didn’t 
even put up a fight. We killed him really fast.<BR>
"You’ve beaten me.... but you’ll never get by.... fry guy....." With 
those words, the crab died.<BR>
We walked threw another door only to see a giant fireball sitting at a 
table drinking tea with a shy guy.<BR>
"Hello, can we talk to Wart?" I asked him.<BR>
"Sure. Go trough the door," he said.<BR>
"That was easy," I told Iggy as we went though the door. Now we had to 
confront Wart.....<BR><BR>
