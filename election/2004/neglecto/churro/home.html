-Target students vulnerable to gang recruitment for special assistance, particularly through the use of peer counselors and support groups. Mentoring, conflict resolution programs, and tutoring can be particularly effective. <BR>

-Create an inviting school climate where every student feels valued. <BR>
-Educate all school staff, including support staff, about how gangs develop and how to respond to them. <BR>

-Monitor youths who are not enrolled in school but "hang out" on or near school property. This can help school officials assess the existence of gangs in the neighborhood, and anticipate and prevent their formation in the school. <BR>
-Offer educational programs for students about gangs, their destructiveness, and how to avoid being drawn into them, preferably in small groups where they can express their feelings comfortably. <BR>
