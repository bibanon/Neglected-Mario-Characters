<h3>Goombario's election site</h3>
<br>
Welcome, please visit the content in each section.<br>
<br>
<b>Quick Candidate Profile:</b><br>
<br>
<b>What is your full name?</b><BR>
Goombario Goomba.<BR><BR>

<b>Which Mario game did you appear in?</b><BR>
Paper Mario.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your favorite color?</b><BR>
Red.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your favorite food group?</b><BR>
FP.<BR><BR>

<b>Who is your Campaign Manager?</b><BR>
Glyph Phoenix. He's a nice guy, but he sets stuff on fire with his mind on accident a lot, and whenever I ask him to make a campaign poster he tells me "One more level, I promise".<BR><BR>

<b>What is your Political Party?</b><BR>
Neglectocrats.<BR><BR>

<b>Why did you join that party?</b><BR>
I'm pretty darn neglected. After I helped Mario save the world he was all like "Sorry, Goombario, but your skills are no longer needed here. We're downsizing our party." What's up with that?<BR><BR>

<b>Why did you decide to run for president?</b><BR>
Goomba's rights. I want to go down in the history books as the first Goomba president. That, and I want to spread the concept of FP and Toad Houses throughout the world.<BR><BR>

<b>What are your plans if you're elected?</b><BR>
I plan to make everything Goomba-accessible. Having no hands, and all, we Goombas have to pick up everything with our mind. Now why did we have to learn telekinesis while those Koopas get arms?<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Speedos?</b><BR>
Outlawed.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Mario?</b><BR>
Am I the only one here who is NOT an anti-mario? I mean, the guy can be a jerk but why are we worried about that when we don't have any flippin' hands!<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on gangs in schools?</b><BR>
Gangs should be replaced by parties. That way, there's always someone to revive your hp if you get killed.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on allowing Squaresoft characters to come to NC?</b><BR>
That's okay, as long as they don't take away my FP and replace it with MP. I hate the taste of MP increasing items. FP increasing items have the best flavor.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on the environment?</b><BR>
I like the Windows environment. I mean, Mac's have better program graphics in general, but Windows just has the compatibility, you know?<BR><BR>

<b>Paper or plastic?</b><BR>
Well, Paper brings back baaaaad memories... I remember when I got stuck in a plastic bag for a week when I was little because I didn't have the arms to pull it off. Plus, the fact that the whole stupid world is made of paper really gets boring. I'd like a change of pace. So plastic.<BR><BR>

<b>Do you have any other comments or statements that you would like to make to the voters?</b><BR>
I've got a cap! Vote Goombario '04!<BR><BR>
