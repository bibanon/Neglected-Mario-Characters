<h3>Fred's speeches site</h3>
<br>
<b>(9/14/04)</b><br>
<br>
Fred: **Gets up to podium** Yo.<br>

Audience: ...<br>

Fred: Vote for me or I'll blow up your house! **Death Rays a house**<br>

Bill: Hey, that was our apartment building!<br>

Fred: Erm... VOTE FOR ME! **Runs off**<br>
<br><hr><br>
<b>(10/9/04) :</b><br>
<br>
Fred, here are some questions:<br><br>

<b>Are you pro-Speedos?</b> <br><br>

Why does everyone think I'm pro-Speedos? I am firmly against them! Yet everyone makes a picture of me with them on! When president (Keyowrd: When), I'll have all speedos set on fire.<br><br>

<b>Any competition to worry about?</b> <br><br>

In the party, definitly not, although Goombario has a good campaign manager. However, I'm still better! HAH! In other parties, I think King Lemming and Dr. Crackle are my main worries. Possibly Bowser.<br><br>

<b>Why run against Bill?</b> <br><br>

Because he made me wear Speedos! Plus, I firmly believe that NC needs a president who's also the mascot. Heck, Bill can be the mascot if I'm feeling generous as president.<br><br>

<b>Why blow up houses of people who don't vote for you?</b> <br><br>

<b>BECAUSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR LOVED ONES, VOTE FOR ME! OR SAY GOODBYE TO YOUR HOUSE!!</b> Any other questions?<br><br>

<b>Nope. *Gulp*</b> <br><br>

Vote for Fred! I actually will make the world a better place!<br>
</body>
