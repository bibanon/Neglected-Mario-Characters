Orlando: We're sorry,folks.Luigi cannot make it in person to be interviewed as he is in Aisa,working to feed the poor Iraqi...
*clip comes up of Luigi at a tanning spa in Hawaii*<br>
Poser: Toad,we all know that's Mario in a green hat.<br>
Mario: Aw...*walks off-screen*<br>
Toad: I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE AGAINST YOUR BLASPHEMY!!<br>
(Later...)<br>
Protesters: TOAD IS A RADICAL EXTREMIST!TOAD IS A-
*clip stops short*<br>
Orlando: O...kay...<br>
Poser: You DID sound just like Fawful just now,Toad...Toad?Toad?Where are you?<br>
Orlando: Ran off,I believe.Anyway,he will be answering our questions-<br>
Poser(While holding up gun to Yet Another Guy): The exact same ones,but only to get the canidate's opinion and have people compare and contrast easily...<br>
Orlando: ...over E-mail.First and foremost ( BOLD SIGNIFIES TYPING ) Luigi,what is your view on the lack of updates?<br>
Luigi: Jay is a very busy man,but I still think that NC should be put on his agenda as well.If elected,I will try to have him update more,as it is his job.<br>
Poser: I like it.<br>
Orlando: And what will you do about the Moron Crisis?<br>
Luigi: I think Morons are inevitable.Some have suggested we put them in a small environment that they may interact with themselves only,but I think that is cruel,as Morons have feelings too.But I do think that we should bring bact the comic "Back to School",perhaps as a series,and put the Morons in it as an effort to teach them.<br>
Poser: Genius...pure genius...I love it!<br>
Orlando: How would you feel if Bill was re-elected?<br>
Luigi: Bill is a good bird.However,I think that he did not do well in his office,and,let's face it,he was a bit of a lame duck.<br>
Poser: Heh...bird pun.<br>
Luigi: Bill is,like I said,a good bird,but should not be kept in office.<br>
Poser: *straining to hold composure*<br>
Orlando: Thank you for your time,Luigi.*shuts off computer*<br>
Poser: A VOTE FOR LUIGI IS A GOOD VOTE!YEAH!ELECT HIM!!!<br>
Orlando: Um...Poser?We're not supposed to be biased...<br>
Poser: LIKE I CARE!HE'S JUST TOO GOOD!!! <br>

<b>(9/19/04)</b><br>
<br>
A huge crowd has gathered for Luigi's campaign speech.Chatting busily,they quiet as Luigi himself,the symbol of Neglectedness,steps up to the podium.<br>
Luigi: Friends,I'd like to thank you for coming here. I want to talk about the energy crisis. Lately, Bowser's frequent attack's on the Mushroom Kingdom,coupled with the fact that Jay's comics have been getting flashier and flashier,have drained much of our energy.So what is the solution to this problem?Some have suggested Electric Pokemon.No,Jay recoils at the thought of it.Some say to just leave it alone.But this problem has to be taken care of. Here's the solution:<br>
Spam.<br>
Yes,spam.Once purified,Spam is an incredible fuel resource. The number of Junk E-mails Jay alone gets in one day could support the United States,in style,for 6 months! Others have thought of this before,you say?True.But it has been impossible to achieve.
But if elected President,I have plans for a factory...a factory than can purify Spam...a factory...FOR THE FUTURE!!!<br>
*people cheer*<br>
