To kick Jay aro-I mean...to help the people!Yeah,that's it.<BR><BR>

<b>What are your plans if you're elected?</b><BR>
I'm going to put more emphasis on the work force.We have little of that at NC,and little money to pay with.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Speedos?</b><BR>
They make good shopping bags!<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Mario?</b><BR>
He makes good pasta!Oh,and contrary to what The EVIL Luigi Story leads many people to believe,I bear no ill will toward him whatsoever,except for the natural sibling rivalry that dwells within us.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on gangs in schools?</b><BR>
Well punish them by making them go out to the NC Deathmatch arena,yelling out all the Pokemon,in numerical order,while standing on their head,burping every 50 Pokemon,and wearing an EXTREMLY tight speedo.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on allowing Squaresoft characters to come to NC?</b><BR>
They can come.They're cool.But not Square themselves.They wouldn't let in SMRPG until the end.Stuck-ups...<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on the environment?</b><BR>
Heck,I'll be soving the energy crisis,the SPAM crisis,and the environment crisis all at the same time!I'd show you my plans for the factory that converts SPAM into energy,but I don't want anyone else using it.<BR><BR>

<b>Paper or plastic?</b><BR>
Speedos.<BR><BR>

<b>Do you have any other comments or statements that you would like to make to the voters?</b><BR>
Yes.If Jay finds it OK,I would like to hold a debate with Fred T. Spanyard after the Election Page is put up,but before the primary elections.<BR><BR>
