<br>
Beam: Going Afternoon, President Clinton.<br>

Bill: It's Bill.<br>

Beam: Right. What did I say?<br>

Bill:...Um...forgetit. Do you have any questions for my campaign?<br>

Beam: Yes, indeed. First off, you'll pass a law for....required permits for wearing speedos?<br>

Bill: Indeed, I am. *Points over to Fred, whom is lying around in breifs.*<br>

Bill: See that man? Do you really want to see stuff like that at home...or at the beach or....at home?<br>

Beam: Not really....but you DO realise he's wearing breifs, not speedos?<br>

Bill: Now I do. But do you REALLY want to see him in speedos?<br>

Beam: Alright, don't want to think about it. NExt question.....You plan to fund the school board to put a stop to gangs?<br>

Bill: That's right, Beam. You see those Tonberry's over there? Mugging that poor old man?<br>

Beam: Um...yeah. Shouldn't we stop them?<br>

Bill: Are you crazy? I'm the president for crying out loud.<br>

Beam:.....okaay. Anyways, go on.<br>

Bill: If we educate them, they'll realize a life beyond gangs and violance and even live a prosperous life.<br>

Beam: Interesting. But Tonberries arn't NC's..<br>

Bill: That's right, they're Immigrants. From Square. That's another problem I plan to fix with a river of gasoline on fire across the border of Square land and NC land.<br>

Beam: Sounds like a cool tourist site. And for the last question....Funding for 'Finding a way to summon Mega Paper Mario to defeat the Toad-Bowser thing'?<br>

Bill: Hey, it destroyed the local Pizza Hut. And I am in no way in hell going to let him get away with that!<br>

Beam: Me neither.<br>

Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Clinton.<br>

Bill: It's.....nevermind. Good day to you, too.<br>
<br>
[Bill for Pres. '04]<br>
