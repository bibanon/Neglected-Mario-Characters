<h1>BILL MOOSE</h1>
<br>
The Bill Moose Party is Bill the Extra Guy's Party.  It's his party, because he says so.  He formed the party as a independent alternative to the powerful Neglectocrats and Subconians.  Bill said he was tired of their corrupt politics, and decided to start his own corrupt politics.  No one really knows how Bill got the money to fund his own party at NC, but somehow he managed.  Not only that, but he was the winner of NC Election 2000.  Currently, Bill is serving as president of NC with his Vice President Kamek.  The Bill Moose Party supports all things extra, and well, I'm sure there's more, but Bill hasn't really cared enough to say what his party stands for.  When you own your own party, who cares, really?<br>
