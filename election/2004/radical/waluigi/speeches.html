<h3>Waluigi's speeches site</h3>
<br>
<b>(10/20/04) :</b><br>
<br>
Waluigi's first (and probably only) speech<br>
Undoubtably bowser is ahead in all the polls as he's worked hard, he's neglected and he's funny. <br><br>

However, look what codiekitty has done... 1 Poster. Thats it. And for some reason King lemming is second in bowsers poll. <br><br>

Obviously dairy is important(although some people take it to the extreme!) but one of the aspects of a good leader is that their hard working.<br><br>

Bowser works hard, I works hard, Dr Crackle works semi-hard. However laziness is not an option. The BIG reason why king lemming is higher up is that Codiekitty is popular.<br><br>

Although codiekitty created Lemmy, and is a good Moderator, look how many pages this topic has took up. 7 Pages! <br><br>

I suggest people look back through the topic before they vote. Therefore I wouldn't be suprised if Bowser won. But please, think before you vote. <br><br>

<b>VOTE FOR THE CHARACTERS NOT THE CAMPAIGN MANAGERS!</b> <br><br>

<i>That was a speech made by Waluigi of the Radical Extremeists. Do not pass go, do not collect £200</i> <br>
