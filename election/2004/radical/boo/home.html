<h3>King Boo's election site</h3>
<br>
Welcome, please visit the content in each section.<br>
<br>
<b>Quick Candidate Profile:</b><br>
<br>
<b>What is your full name?</b><BR>
King Boo the First.<BR><BR>

<b>Which Mario game did you appear in?</b><BR>
Luigi's Mansion.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your favorite color?</b><BR>
White!<BR><BR>

<b>What is your favorite food group?</b><BR>
I don't eat food. I AM a ghost, so I'm already dead.<BR><BR>

<b>Who is your Campaign Manager?</b><BR>
Some guy called Chompmaster. He made this comic series on me during his early comic making days.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your Political Party?</b><BR>
Radical Extremists.<BR><BR>

<b>Why did you join that party?</b><BR>
Blame Chompmaster. He didn't tell me.<BR><BR>

<b>Why did you decide to run for president?</b><BR>
I'm a King, so I have ruling skills. And I want to scare Jay into hurrying up with more hilarious comics like the eighth part of NC/SSS Mach 2!<BR><BR>

<b>What are your plans if you're elected?</b><BR>
I will do what I said above, rid us of Evil Mario clones, and whip NC back to shape!<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Speedos?</b><BR>
A waste of money.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Mario?</b><BR>
I think the only good thing about him is the fact he gives supermarkets and restaraunts actual reasons to exsist!<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on gangs in schools?</b><BR>
They should die unless they become nice, friendly groups.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on allowing Squaresoft characters to come to NC?</b><BR>
They can only come if they have Jay's permission. If they sneak in, I will boot out the un-Neglected ones.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on the environment?</b><BR>
Without it, we would die. The environment rocks.<BR><BR>

<b>Paper or plastic?</b><BR>
Paper is better for our environment, but plastic is stronger... I guess Paper.<BR><BR>

<b>Do you have any other comments or statements that you would like to make to the voters?</b><BR>
Bombette says a vote for me is a vote for terrorism. Thats not true. A vote for her, though, is a vote for deadly gangs. And, BITMAP FORMATS ARE EEEEEVVVVIILLL!!!!!<BR><BR>
