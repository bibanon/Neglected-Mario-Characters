<h3>King Boo's speeches site</h3>
<br>
<b>(10/24/04) :</b><br>
<br>
This is not supposed to make anyone angry, hurt or annoyed. IT IS THE TRUTH (most of the time)!!! So don't be offended. Or King Boo will get angry.<br>
King Boo: Hi! I'm King Boo! My Campaign Manager, Chompmaster, has an interview with questions giving to him by Jay Resop! <br>
The questions he's making for everyone is why his comics aren't ready yet.<br>
CM: Ok, King Boo. Your first question is: Why vote for you and not the others?<br>
King Boo: Well, First off, Petey Piranah is a sprite stealer.<br>
Audience: GASP! WE DON'T WANT A NO-CREDIT GIVING SPRITE STEALER HERE!<br>
King Boo: Well, it's not that bad! He could be a pretty good leader :under his breath: I guess... :back to normal talking: Secondly, Waluigi is just a filler with no personality. Why vote for a lifeless husk? It would be like putting a cake in a battle against a fat guy! Third, Fawful would just make you eat mustard that would kill you. Namely, Mustard of Doom. Also, Bombette will just blow everything up.<br>
CM: What about the guys used to ruling over stuff?<br>
King Boo: Dr. Crackle and I are close friends. Although Mr.Cryde isn't who you should vote for. Just Dr. Crackle. It is possible to do that. Bowser, well, he's my boss. I would vote him if you don't vote me. King Lemming is a psycopath, but had a major role in Mario Busters.<br>
CM: Next question. Why vote you?<br>
King Boo: Oh yeah, that part of the question. Well, I'll scare Jay until he makes comics, and will force him to make him give you a little preview to each one before relase.<br>
Auidience: YEAH!!!<br>
King Boo: And if Petey Piranah says anything about this speech or me, he's just a fat, goop spitting liar. That's the truth folks. Oh yeah, I'll give You the chance to see what Jay does in a day.<br>
Auidence: Would'nt that be boring when he does no sprite comic work?<br>
King Boo: We'll make it interesting, trust us.<br>
CM: Ok, that's the end of our short interview! See you next time!<br>
King Boo for NC, voting him is the best for NC.<br>
