<h3>Bowser's speeches site</h3>
<br>
<b>(9/15/04)</b><br>
<br>
Koopa: So, Bowser, you say you want to run for president, but WHY do you want to be president of NC? <br>

Bowser: Well, after countless times of trying to defeat Mario and failing (mostly because of the Gamer's awesome skills, and NOT because of Mario himself), I figured it would be a good step forward to organize the group that's always been against Mario. NC Has always stood it's ground of anti-Marioism, and I will keep that ground if my life depends on it. <br>

Koopa: Really?<br>

Bowser: Sure. I've got about 99 extra lives. <br>

Koopa: Cool. Now that that's settled, what do you plan to do once you make it into office. <br>

Bowser: NC is in dire need of updates. If Jay doesn't do something within the week, I'll rush over to his house and burninate one of his most priceless posessions. That'll motivate his updates! <br>

Koopa: Ruthless, but efficient! And considering how Jay is, he won't be keeping many of his prized posessions for long!<br>

Bowser: Exactly. He has little choice if he wants to keep his SNES alive. <br>

Koopa: I see...now what do you plan on doing about the massive tax inflation? How will our tax rates change?<br>

Bowser: You mean the tax rate of zero percent?<br>

Koopa: Yes. <br>

Bowser: I'll cut it in half. <br>

Koopa: YES! High Score! Okay, so one more question, then we'll be accepting questions from the audience. How do you know Trogdor?<br>

Bowser: We went to Burniniation classes together. <br>

Koopa: Wow! Cool! Okay, now for the audience. Questions, anyone?<br>
<br><hr><br>
<b>(//04) :</b><br>
<br>
A new political announcement for Bowser for 2004! <br><br>

Voiceover: Many of the candidates you know have been tied to scandals, including the support and/or restrictions placed upon Speedo wearing, plots for world destruction, reportedly trying to conquer NC Land for their own sick and twisted benefits, severe psychological problems, extreme environmental acts, split-personalities, and lastly, but not leastly, the fear, allowance, and support of Marios in our own land! Do you want any of these candidates to be your new president? I think not. <br><br>

Bowser: Hello. I'm Bowser Koopa. You all know me as Mario's #1 enemy. My goals are clear-cut. To keep Mario out and to push forward more updates! I don't support any extreme actions such as dictatorship, excessive planting of deadly piranha plants (though I do enjoy clean, fresh air). I've always been very orderly about keeping all the lands I watch over clean and orderly, and in tip top condition both physically and mentally. You can trust me to lead this website to greatness. Vote for me, for honesty. <br><br>

Bowser for 2004. Bowser, a name you can trust. <br><br>

Koopa: What about Speedos? <br><br>

Bowser: I don't hold anything against people who MUST wear them, but for those who would rather not (ahem) "see" this display...(Holds up a pair of sunglasses) Extra-dark sunglasses for all! (Passes them out to the crowd)<br><br>

Crowd: (Cheers) <br>
