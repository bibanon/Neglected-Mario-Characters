For now, we will be running the primary campaigns.  This means the candidates will be allowed to make posters, speeches, and other promotional material for their campaign for the presidency.  We will run the campaign for approximately one month, and then we'll announce when the voting dates will be for each party's primary.  We will probably have the voting done through e-mail.  Until then, we will try to get a page up on the site for each candidate to show off their election material.  Then, you will vote for your favorite candidate in each party for the Primary Election.  Once we have a winner for each party, we will begin with the general election campaign.  For now, just sit back and relax and read the posters that people have already made for the election.  <A HREF="http://www.vgf.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum;f=42">You can see all of the election campaign posters in the NC Forum.</A>  Enjoy!

<B>9/12/04</B><BR>
That's right.  It's finally time again for the NC Elections.  That means that you, the fans, have the chance to vote once again on who should become the President of NC.  Bill the Extra Guy, current President, will be defending his seat and will be running for reelection.  YOUR job right now is to choose who you want to see run against him!  The candidates can be any character, as long as they are Mario characters.  And no, Mario can't run.  Heh.  There will be four parties in the election:
<UL>
<LI>Neglectocrats
<LI>Subconians
<LI>Radical Extremists
<LI>Bill Moose Party (Bill's Party)
</UL>
Right now, only Bill is running.  So that means we need candidates for the other parties.  Now, this election will run a little differently then the last one.  I'm going to be giving the fans more power over the entire process.  Also, the NC Election 2004 will be run for the most part in the <A HREF="http://www.vgf.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum;f=42">NC Forum</A>.  So if you arn't registered, you may want to do so soon.  You can find more details about how the election will be run in the current <A HREF="http://www.vgf.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=42;t=002414">Official Primary Registration topic</A>.  But here is a summary of how it's going to work:<BR><BR>
-First, we begin with the primaries.  Every person is allowed to register one character for the NC Election.  You choose which party you want that character to run under.  You will then be the Campaign Manager for that candidate and will be in charge of making campaign speeches, posters, and ect for the candidate.  These things should all be posted in the NC Forum and will eventually get put up here on the site.<BR><BR>
-After everyone has registered, we will hold the Primary election, where everyone gets to vote for one character from each party.  We'll have voting on both the Forum and through e-mail.  The winner of each party's primary will then be able to go on to the General Election.<BR><BR>
-Before the General Election, each party's candidate must select a running mate, or a Vice President.  This is preferably someone else from their party.<BR><BR>
-The candidates and running mates are then allowed to make more posters, speeches, have debates, ect up until the General Election.  We'll then set a date for the General election, and have voting like we did before, through the Forums and through e-mail.  Everyone picks one candidate to vote for, and in the end, the winner will become President of NC!<BR><BR>
Please note, that things are still a little sketchy right now, and the plans for the election are still in draft form, since I just came up with idea off the top of my head a day ago.  So please bear with me if I change the format of the election in any way.<BR><BR>
So for now, please go to the NC Forum if you want to register a character who you'd like to have run for the election.  Thanks and I hope you all have fun.<BR><BR>
Registration is now closed.<BR>
