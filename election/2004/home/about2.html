<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<br>
Four years ago Bill the Extra Guy was elected president of Neglected Characters in the 2000 NC Election.<br>
Now it's time to election process once again to choose a president for Neglected Mario Characters.<br>
This time, thirty-two NCs run against Bill in four different parties:
There are the Neglectocrats, the Subconians, the Radical Extremists and the Retro Activists.<br>
<br>
Every candidate has a Campaign Manager (CM) who will run the campaign and try to get his character voted into office.<br>
They have about a month to make speeches, posters and anything else they want to do to get as many people vote for them as possible in the primary elections.<br>
The main part of the campaign takes place in the <a href="http://www.vgf.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=forum;f=42" target=window>NC Forum</a>, but it will also be transfered to this page.<br>
<br>
Sometime in early November, the primary elections will be held where everyone gets to vote for one character from each party.<br>
The primary elections will take place one party at a time, and voting will take place through e-mail.<br>
The winner of each party's primary will then be able to go on to the general election.<br>
<br>
Before the general election, each party's candidate must select a running mate, or a Vice President. This is preferably someone else from their party.<br>
The candidates and running mates are then allowed to make more posters, speeches, have debates, and such for another month until the General Election.<br>
We'll have voting like we did before, through e-mail.<br>
Everyone picks one candidate to vote for, and in the end, the winner will become <b>President of NC!</b><br>
<br>
You can view most of the promotional material on this site.<br>
Just navigate through the menu on the left.<br>
Clicking on a party opens new menu points, each for every candidate.<br>
When you click on a candidate you come to his site, shown on the right side.<br>
There you can navigate through his material by using the buttons "Home", "Speeches", "Posters" and "The Rest" at the top.<br>
<br>
Now go and have fun!<br>
