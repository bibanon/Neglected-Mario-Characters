<h3>Birdo's election site</h3>
<br>
<b>NEWS:</b><br>
<br>
Welcome, please visit the content in each section.<br>
<br>
<b>Quick Candidate Profile:</b><br>
<br>
<b>What is your full name?</b><BR>
Birdo. Yup. That's it. No last name, given, or needed.<BR><BR>

<b>Which Mario game did you appear in?</b><BR>
Super Mario Bros. 2.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your favorite color?</b><BR>
Pink. Isn't that obvious?<BR><BR>

<b>What is your favorite food group?</b><BR>
Well, I prefer food, but paper is sometimes good. ...Don't ask me why I said that.<BR><BR>

<b>Who is your Campaign Manager?</b><BR>
That...dyslexic hedgehog guy. I can't pronounce his name, so I'm not gonna try.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your Political Party?</b><BR>
I'm a Subconian, and I'm proud of it!<BR><BR>

<b>Why did you join that party?</b><BR>
See previous answer.<BR><BR>

<b>Why did you decide to run for president?</b><BR>
Well, I felt NC needed some changes, specially, more updates and less Mario. And I intend to make them happen...ONE way, or another!<BR><BR>

<b>What are your plans if you're elected?</b><BR>
First of all, I plan on getting Jay to update more. No matter how many eggs I have to shoot him with. Second, I plan on giving NCs everywhere the attention and respect they deserve. ...And if they don't deserve it...they won't get any.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Speedos?</b><BR>
Go as fast as you can. Less law enforcement all around! ...Wait, you said Speeders, right? ...OH! Speedos! ......eww...<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on Mario?</b><BR>
...eww...again. I plan on locking 'em away the moment I'm elected...or sooner.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on gangs in schools?</b><BR>
Oh! I remember River City Ransom! That game was awesome! ...Oh...wait...wrong kinda gangs, right?<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on allowing Squaresoft characters to come to NC?</b><BR>
First of all, squares aren't soft. They're hard, and have pointy edges. Pointy edges are bad, and I won't be having any of them in NC if I'm elected.<BR><BR>

<b>What is your policy on the environment?</b><BR>
Not homely enough. To make it more friendly, I plan on planting more oddly out-of-place pine trees, mysterious vines that can grow even in the sky, and vegetables.<BR><BR>

<b>Paper or plastic?</b><BR>
What's that gotta do with anyth-paper. *Quickly eats it* ...What?!<BR><BR>

<b>Do you have any other comments or statements that you would like to make to the voters?</b><BR>
Why, yes I do. Friends, fellow NCs...if you don't vote for me, I'll be sure to shoot you all with eggs! And not just those SMB2 kind, I mean the explosive kind I learned to fire in Mario RPG! Don't think I'm just kidding; I really will! You wanna try me, punk?! ...S'what I thought... <BR><BR>
