<br>
<b>(9/14/04) Time for Simon's promised speach!</b><br>
<br>
"No score and four years ago our founding father, Jay Resop, let Bill the extra guy into office. Since then, Bill's corruption has not only costed the NC government hundreds of bucks, but has also costed the Neglected Mario Characters. The money he waisted on useless things, such as a jacuzzi, should not of been spent. Simon says if elected, then he will put Bill to hard work, paying off the terrible debt he has put the future president in. Now, for the benifits: If elected, Simon says he will make updates larger and more often. Oh yeah! A vote for Simon is a vote for freedom! Simon says he will give free picles to everyone if he's elected. Simon says he asked 8-Ball if he would be a great president. 8-Ball replied 'Yes.'
So, in conclusion, simon says, vote for me!!!!"
