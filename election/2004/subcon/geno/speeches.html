<h3>Geno's speeches site</h3>
<br>
<b>(9/15/04)</b><br>
<br>
X-3: Heres Geno's speech! Ready Rush?<br>

Rush: Yep. We're here live, with Geno's speech! Hey, lok! He's starting!<br>

Geno: Hello everybody. I'm Geno, and I hope to be your future NC president. For a couple of years, you had to listen to BILL, the current NC president. Now I can see, that he, has done a horrible job. However, I will fix this mess, and become the best NC president I can be! Most of you might not like me, cause I'm 3-D, and most of you may be 8-bit or 16-bit, but dont wory, I'm not a Mario, I'm a Neclector! I hope, that some of you will join me, on my quest, to save NC! What do you want?<br>

NCs: MORE RESPECT!<br>

Geno: Exacly. Plus If you vote for me, I'll teach you magic! Thank you, that is all.<br>

NCs: WHOO!!! *Clap* *Clap* *Clap*<br>

Rush: What a great speech. Back to you X-3.<br>

X-3: Well, that was a great speech. Hey, look! Thats all the time we have today! See you tomorow on.... Raccoon news! Oh, and remember, VOTE FOR GENO!<br>
