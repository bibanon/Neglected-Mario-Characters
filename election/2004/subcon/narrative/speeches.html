<h3>Narrative Guy's speeches site</h3>
<br>
<b>(9/12/04) Interview Time!</b><br>
<br>
Orland: Lyle here, interviewing Narrative Guy!<br>

Poser: Woooooooooooooo! Deathmatch!<br>

Orland: ..okay? Narrative Guy, what is your view on the serious lack of updates?<br>

Narrative Guy: "Well," I said pretneding that i cared, "I plan on getting however my vice president might be to take car of everything for me."<br>

Poser: Well, at least he's honest.<br>

Orland: Yeah. What about the Moronitsisis crisis?<br>

Narrative Guy: "It's an easy answer," I explained. I pulled the lever behind me and watched as the idiotic announcer fell into the pit. I showed Orland how I planned to de-contaminate him from the deadly Moron disease.<br>

Poser: Um, what's he talking about?<br>

Narrative Guy: I shut up as I realized I was just day-dreaming, and said "If elected, I plan on hiring a S.W.A.T. team, I mean, a team of counselors to talk the moron out of patients."<br>

Orland: Right. I'm just going to skip to the main question: how would you feel if everyone's main competition Bill the Extra Guy wins president for a second term?<br>

Narrative Guy: "Oh, Bill's a fine man, er, bird. I'm sure I and all of the other nominees would be glad if Bill became president," I lied, hiding my rifle.<br>

Poser: Hey, he wasn't day-dreaming that time!<br>

Orland: Okay, can we end this before I have to go to a therapist?<br>

Poser: Fine with me.<br>

Narrative Guy: "All right," I told the smelly announcer.<br>

Orland: I'm Lyle Orland,<br>

Poser: and I'm John Poser II. Goodnight, NC Land. <br>
