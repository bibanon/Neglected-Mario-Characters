Welcome to the Official Voting page for the NC Election 2008!<BR><BR>
We are currently running the voting stage now.  Please take the time to read the rules and submit your vote.<BR><BR>
There are four parties running in the election, and so we will be holding each of their Primary Elections this month.  We will have the primaries one at a time, and they will each last for one week.  So be sure to vote in each one.  And you can only vote during the time allowed for each party.  OK, so here's schedule:<BR><BR>
1) Subconians (November 9th - November 15th) <b>*COMPLETE*</B><BR>
2) Nintendoites (November 16th - November 22nd) <b>*COMPLETE*</B><BR>
3) Radical Extremists (November 23rd - November 29th) <b>*COMPLETE*</B><BR>
4) Retro Activists (November 30th - December 6th) <b>*COMPLETE*</B><BR><BR>

Your job is to select one of these candidates who you want to vote for and submit it to <A HREF="mailto:smbhqmail@gmail.com?Subject=NC Election - Retro Activists">smbhqmail@gmail.com</A>.  The winner of this primary will get to move on to the final round, the General Election.  So your vote is important.  So, in summary, here are the general rules:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Go through the election pages for the candidates above and make your final choice out of those eight characters.
<LI>Once you have selected one, submit that character's name to <A HREF="mailto:smbhqmail@gmail.com?Subject=NC Election - Retro Activists">smbhqmail@gmail.com</A>.
<LI>Even if you voted in the previous primary from last week, you are still allowed to vote in the current one.
<LI>You may only vote once in this primary.
<LI>We are only voting for this current party right now.  So please only submit one name out of those eight, and nothing more.
<LI>This primary will run from X till Y.  Votes will only be accepted during this time.  After this time, the primaries will be over.  Bam.  Done.
</UL>
So, are we all good?  Happy voting!
