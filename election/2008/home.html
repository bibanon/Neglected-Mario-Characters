OK, decided to compress things to save time.  This page will only include the basics.  Click the forum links on the sidebar for all the campaigning.  However, it is time we start voting.  <a href="vote.html">Click here</a> to start with the Subconian party.
<BR><BR>

<B>11/01/08</B><BR>
We are running a little behind, so I think it's time to fast track a bit.<P>

The campaigns have been going steady on the boards, so the preliminary voting will begin in one week's time with the Subconian Party<p>

The profiles for that party is now up and the rest will slowly filter in as I finish them.

The elections are back!  Once again you get to choose the NC president.  Churro, current President, will be defending his seat and will be running for reelection.  YOUR job right now is to choose who you want to see run against him!  The candidates can be any character, as long as they are Mario characters (with the exception of the Nintendoites).  And no, Mario can't run.  There will be six parties in the election:
<UL>
<LI>Neglectocrats (incumbant Churro)
<LI>Subconians
<LI>Retro Activists
<LI>Radical Extremists
<LI>Bill Moose Party
<LI>Nintendoites
</UL>
Officially, only Churro is currently running.  So that means we need candidates for the other parties.  Once again, the election will be run for the most part in the <A HREF="http://www.vgf.com/forums/neglected-characters-forum-s-duckblur/">NC Forum</A>.  So if you arn't registered, you may want to do so soon.  Nominations are now open in the <A HREF="http://www.vgf.com/forums/neglected-characters-forum-s-duckblur/64512-election-2008-official-nomination-topic.html">Official Nomination topic</A>.  Here is how the election works:<BR><BR>
-First, we begin with the primaries.  Every person is allowed to register one character for the NC Election.  You choose which party you want that character to run under.  You will then be the Campaign Manager for that candidate and will be in charge of making campaign speeches, posters, and ect for the candidate.  These things should all be posted in the NC Forum and will eventually get put up here on the site.<BR><BR>
-After everyone has registered, we will hold the Primary election, where everyone gets to vote for one character from each party.  We'll have voting on both the Forum and through e-mail.  The winner of each party's primary will then be able to go on to the General Election.<BR><BR>
-Before the General Election, each party's candidate must select a running mate, or a Vice President.  This is preferably someone else from their party.<BR><BR>
-The candidates and running mates are then allowed to make more posters, speeches, have debates, ect up until the General Election.  We'll then set a date for the General election, and have voting like we did before, through the Forums and through e-mail.  Everyone picks one candidate to vote for, and in the end, the winner will become President of NC!<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
So for now, please go to the NC Forum if you want to register a character who you'd like to have run for the election.  Thanks and I hope you all have fun.<BR><BR>
