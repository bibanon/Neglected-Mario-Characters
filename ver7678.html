<B> Hot Foot By, Unknown</B><BR>
I know I sent this before, but now that Hot Foot is on the NC Name Game,
I must send it again:<BR>

Lives: Fortresses<BR>
Age: Eternal unless you turn on the sprinklers...<BR>
Height: 5-6 (Tall for a flame)<BR>
Weight: He melted the scale<BR>
Likes: Oil, gasoline, and grabbing Bob-Ombs by the fuse<BR>
Dislikes: Boo Diddly for stealing his spotlight<BR>

Hot Foot was created when Fire Chomp flew into the castles one day,
sneezing from his allergic reaction to Ptooie and Nipper Plants.  A
stray fireball from his sneezes landed on one of Bowser's magic candles,
thus creating the burning one we know and love.  Hot Foot quickly
developed some sense of intelligence, as he told Fire Chomp to stay out
of the Pipe Maze, which is why you never see him there.  He also
dislocated the base flame of Fire-Bar, and threw it into Bowser's main
computer, creating the Roto-Disc.  Then he threw red paint into the lava
pits to give Podoboo a new look.  Having done all he cared to do, Hot
Foot retired to his candle in Bowser's Castle, where he remains to this
day.  But he's a little bit lonely up there, which is why he follows the
Mario Bros.  If they dare tread into the castle.  As for the rest of the
Hot Foot gang, well, let's just say that Hot Foot ran into one of the
Podoboos old flames while on vacation in Land of the Giants...<BR><BR>


<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
Woops.  Again, I forgot to copy the name.  Sorry again.  I might have put up this guy's other Hot Foot Bio, so look for it.

<B>Tuxedo Ken By, Tuxedo Ken</B><BR>

Name: Ken<BR>
Age: 18<BR>
Height: Last time I checked, he’s 6’1<BR>
Weight: No one knows<BR>
Number of pizza slices (small) he can eat in one day: 6<BR>
Number or times he’s had to rescue Yoshette: Too many to count!<BR>

After appearing for the second time in Mario’s World, Ken was trained
by the
Mario Bros. But when Bowser and his creeps started going after Yoshi’s
new love
interest, Yoshette, Ken suddenly felt that he should protect her as
best as he can,
because she would play an important role in the future. When he
discovered the
truth about Yoshette, he knew that she had to protect the world from
all evil. <BR>

During the time when Koopa’s former sister, Koopette, had the Sailor
Yoshies, the
protectors of the world trapped, a mysterious person called “Tuxedo
Ken” appeared
and rescued them. A few weeks later, Yoshette and her friends
discovered that Ken
was actually the mysterious stranger that rescued them. Ken then
redesigned his
time machine to fit six people. The six people going on this journey
were himself and
his friends, Yoshette, Yoshida, Yoshina, Yoshella and Yoshira, who
were the Sailor
Yoshies, and took them back 1,000 years, and discovered that he was a
prince, and
that Yoshette was the princess of the Yoshies, and that the two of
them were to wed
each other, but Koopette attacked the kingdom and killed them, and the
other eight
Sailor Yoshies, who were unknown at the time.<BR>

Ken and Yoshette were wed after the defeat of Koopa’s team, and were
ruling the
world peacefully, until the intergalactic being, Smithy, attacked and
stole Yoshette’s
crystal. But in the future, the Sailor Yoshies defeated Smithy with
their “Sailor
Yoshi Power”, unaware that Smithy’s partner, Exor, was still alive.<BR>

As Tuxedo Ken, it is his job to protect Yoshette from the evil beings
who want to
destroy her and take over the world, and become the future king of the
world. Ken’s
signature symbol is a red rose, so when enemies see that, they know
that they’re also
dealing with Tuxedo Ken.<BR>

I am Tuxedo_Ken, protector and husband of Sailor Yoshette. hehehehehe<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
OK...odd...

<B> Mezzo Bomb By, Pokemaniac</B><BR>
 
Name: Mezzo Bomb ( a.k.a. bob-omb buddy )<BR>
1st Appaerance: Super Mario 64<BR>
Species: Pink Bob-omb, Male ( very rare )<BR>
Likes: Peace<BR>
Hates: War <BR>

One day Bowser called upon some more Bob-Ombs to go destroy Mario. One,
however, was a Pink Bob-omb named Mezzo Bomb. Mezzo didn't like fighting
or
 war, so he stayed away from other bob-ombs in bob-omb battlefeild. one
day, 
 a guy named Mario came, and asked to borrow Mezzo's Cannon. soon, Mezzo
 and Mario became good freinds. Mezzo followed Mario all around the
world. 
 Whenever Mario needed him to activate the cannon, he was there. So, the
 next time you say how great mario is, Remember that it all wouldn't have
been 
 possible without the true Mushroom Hero, Mezzo Bomb!!!!<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
I should play SM64 sooner or later.
<BR><BR>
