Question 201: How do we know you're a guy? 'Dr.' could easily be a female.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: You mean I've been going into the wrong restrooms all of these years? This could be why I havn't gotten many dates over the years. Wait a minute, I'm not female! Dr. Donez is all man, baby! At least I think. <BR><BR>
Question 202: Did you know Bill back in the SMB2 days? <BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Nah, not really. Being confined to Level 1-1 of SMB2, and Bill being in Level 1-2, we never ran into each other. I saw him a few times at the company picnic, however. Bill was flying round with orange peels on his head yelling "I'm a yellow bananna!" I didn't first meet him until Fred introduced him to me at NC. <BR><BR>
Question 203: How do you do?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: How do I do? The toilet? I really don't want to have to go into that here. <BR><BR>
Question 204: What time is it?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: By my watch, 13:61cm. I think it's broke. <BR><BR>
Question 205: What's my name? <BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Billy Bob? <BR><BR>
Question 206: If BxB=C, and C-B=B,and B squared = C,<BR>
What does B =, + what does C =?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, they can both be equal to zero. <BR><BR>
Question 207: I had software where you could play playstation on your computer called bleem! do you know where I lost that at??<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Check under your bed? I lose all of my stuff there. (Dr. D looks under his bed). Hey cool! An old tape of Smurf episodes! <BR><BR>
Question 208: If the world were the size of a pinhead, how far away would the nearest star be? <BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Um...lets see... By my calculations...(Runs). <BR><BR>
Question 209: What moves does Jay Respo have?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Jay Respo, being a clone of Jay Resop, has very little power. I think all he's actually good for is jumping out of windows. Pretty dumb ability if you ask me. <BR><BR>
Question 210: What's the difference between Fred's Death ray, Ray of Death and Deathly Deathray of Deathly Deathness?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Well, simply put, the Death Ray does "Extremely Massive Damage", the Ray of Death does "Massively Extreme Damage" and the Deathly Deathray of Deathly Deathness does "Extremely Massive Damage of Massively Extremeness". Does that help? <BR><BR>
Question 211: Do you like donuts? <BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Heck yeah. Exspecially covered with ant guts. <BR><BR>
Question 212: Why I have to wear THIS!!!?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Why not? <BR><BR>
Question 213: Will Fred go out and date my cat?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: I asked Fred and he declined. He sends your cat his appologies for not going and gives it a personal Ray of Death. <BR><BR>
Question 214: Can I be an extra guy too?? <BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Nope, there is only one Extra Guy, and he's Bill. <BR><BR>
Question 215: I've been wondering why nobody asked this, if they did well, what is an extra guy?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: A Guy who's Extra. What more needs to be explained? <BR><BR>
Question 216: Ehhh, what's up doc.<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: Mostly Nitrogen Gas. If you look up high enough, you'll reach O-Zone.<BR><BR>
Question 217: Haha, your funny Dr. Donez... Right?<BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No, you're wrong. I'm not funny at all. So why do you laugh at me. WHY??? <BR><BR>
Question 218: Uhm, are you by any chance a guy in a halloween costume? <BR>
Dr. Donez's Answer: No, I'm Dr. Donez! <BR><BR>
Question 219: Oh and, are you funnier than this?<BR>

Question 221: Do you think I can make a cool Mario type of comic like Jay Resop??<BR>
