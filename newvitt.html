</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Vittorio Spike </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  J. D. Martin a.k.a. JMycroft<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Vittorio Spike<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Male<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Hard to say... Maybe in Italy... Perhaps the Mushroom Planet?<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Genarro, Petunia, Kuribo, Jugem, Donkey Kong, Mushrooms, young Mario Bros.<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Kamek, his ex-wife (unnamed), his son Warua "Wario" Spike<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Loner, though he's basically good, albeit a bit sneaky.<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  Taller than Genarro, lean figure.  Beady eyes, large purple nose, cleft chin, pointy ears, 	handlebar mustache, large leering grin.  Slick black hair, parted in the middle, ringmaster style.
	Dresses like a flashy carnival barker, purple vest, bow tie, pin-stripe shirt with puffy sleeves, 		(remember Swanky's outfit in DKC?Just picture that) , white gloves with emblazoned V's.  Wears
	a black cape with a giant white V on the back.  Carries a long black cane or wand, with a gold
	bat-shaped knob, with a V carved into it.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  This interdimensional impressario traveled freely between the Mushroom World and ours.  		  Distant cousin of the Booster family and God knows what else.  Married (and divorced) several
	times.  Traveled the Mushroom lands collecting strange creatures and objects, and displayed them
	in our world, and then vice versa.  Met Genarro and Petunia and conducted them to the
	Mushroom World.  He married, and had twins, Warua and Warui (he named them using the 	Japanese word for 'bad' because they were disagreeable babies.  I know what you are thinking.  	Yes, he had been in Japan.  He also gave DK his name.  The ape was part of his act.)  He fought 	with his shrewish wife over everything, including the kids' names.  They soon divorced, and she 	took Warui with her to Crystal Land, calling him "Waruigi."  Later, when it was decided to seal the 	warp pipe between the worlds, Vittorio agreed to adopt young Mario and Luigi (who were 4 yrs. 	old at the time) and raise them our world, as part of his circus.  Warua, whom everyone called 	"Wario" was clearly jealous.  Vittorio realized this, and tried to overcompensate by using little 	discipine on his own son, to little avail.  Wario was still jealous, and became spoiled and 	unprincipled as well.  Finally, when all three came of age, he closed down his circus and retired, 	sending all three lads (19 yrs. at the time) to America.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  I dunno.  Super Mario Parents RPG?  Could appear in SMB 3 in the black mushroom house, where 	he gives items like the Shyguy Suit, Boo Suit, Seal Suit, and Gator Suit.  And candy.<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Alive???   Retired.   Probably living in Italy.  Recently told Wario about his long-lost brother.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  One of my most original characters.  Will appear in my Great Mario Biography.  He is sneaky, and
	semi-honest (he is a carnival barker, after all) but he is a good guy at heart.<BR>
