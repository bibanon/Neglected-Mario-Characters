<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  Yo`ster was born on Yoshi`s Island when the Super Happy Tree was stolen. He was the green Yoshi that helped save it. After that, Yo`ster lived a fairly normal life, until one day when Bowser (in his Koopa Kopter) grabbed Yo`ster and stuffed him into an egg. Mario saved Yo`ster and Yo`ster helped Mario save Peach. After that, he helped Yoshis save the island whenever Bowser attacked. One day, Yo`ster looked into his wallet and realized that all the coins that he had collected had added up. He was a multiquadrupalquadrillionaire. With all his money he bought a small isle and named it Yo`ster`s Isle. After that he went on a long journey and collected all 151 Pokemon. Soon after, Bowser had created a cyborg named Bronze Robo-Yoshi that attacked Yoshi`s Island. The only Yoshi that could defeat him was Yo`ster B. Yo`ster saved the day and now Bronze Robo-Yoshi lives in te Yo`ster`s Isle junkyard.<BR>
