<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" >
<CENTER> <H2> Clumsy Koopa </H2> </CENTER> 

<B>Created By:</B>  RED<BR>

<B>Name:</B>  Clumsy Koopa<BR>

<B>Gender:</B>  Male<BR>

<B>Birthplace:</B>  Koopa Village<BR>

<B>Friends:</B>  Mario, Luigi, etc.<BR>

<B>Enemies:</B>  Bowser, the Turtle Tribe, and other threats to the Mushroom
Kingdom<BR>

<B>Good / Evil / Loner / Neutral:</B>  Good<BR>

<B>Description of looks:</B>  He looks like the Koopa Troopas, except his shell
is in a rainbow of colors, but still friendly.<BR>

<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  He likes to be helpful, but like the name
says, he's all thumbs, and sometimes gets things right.<BR>

<B>Mario Games that this Character would fit in (Made up games or Real games):</B>  Paper Mario, Mario Party 3<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Peach's Castle<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  He has good attacks, fine stamina, but usually he misses
his attacks, but he never hits his partner (except the odds of that are
1 in 50).  He's not a good dancer, but sings fine, but all Koopa Troopas
in Koopa Village still respect him (including Kooper).  He's scared of
ghosts, especially Boos, VERY shy of females, not too scared of the
dark, but when it comes to swimming, he's top-notch, so he never screws
up when swimming.  Mario will need to carry some X Accuracy along so
Clumsy Koopa and attack straight.  Cons: Clumsiness, when he gets
confused, he can sometimes strike his own partner by mistake (or
himself), he's quite slow, and when he helps, he trips on his own two
feet.  Pros: He is a good partner, his swimming is top-notch, and in
Mario Party 3, since his low pay is a total plus, players only need to
pay one coin, making his Attack: 2, Stamina: 3, and Salary: 1.<BR>
