<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  In order to spite Jay Resop's request to keep his site American, Super Markio created this character and set it loose on the world. He likes to use proper English and not that dialect that Americans speak, and he likes to drink lots and lots of tea and eat crumpets on the castle moors. He fought against Mario once, but neither one could understand their accents so they wandered off... this could be because he sounds like Dick Van Dyke or Ringo Starr (he switches between the two).<BR>

<B>Currently:</B>  Eating fish and chips down the bloody hell West End.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  Now this is a stereotype, English people are just like Americans, only our houses are smaller, our education system better and we hate all other nations with no valid reason.<BR>
