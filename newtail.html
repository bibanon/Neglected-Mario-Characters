<B>Short Description of Life:</B>  George is your common, every-day American living in New York.  He earns about $20,000 a year, but he's single, so he gets by pretty well.   George met Mario and Luigi before they went to the Mushroom Kingdom.  When they started their plumbing business, they decided to go to his shop to get a new look.  He gave them their trademark outfits.  After returning from the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario and Luigi told him about their adventures.  When he told them that they were crazy, they quit coming to his shop.  His shop has kept in good business since then.<BR>

<B>Other Comments:</B>  When he was a little kid, he accidentally went to Harlem with a segregation sign...he still has the bruises from that fight.  Oh yeah, he is in no way related to any Mushroom Kingdom character…so quit your pondering.<BR>
