Worst nightmare: A team of Yoshis with long tongues trying to eat him<BR><BR>

Boshi was born to a red yoshi and a yellow yoshi. He liked to boss
people around, hence the mix of "Bully" and "Yoshi" for his name. One
day he discovered Yoster' Isle. He went there, bossed everybody around,
beat them in a race and became the boss. Then Yoshi came with his
plumber. Boshi did not like this, but he accepted Yoshi's challenge of a
race anyway. Oh my- somebody actually BEAT him! After the defeat of
Smithy, he went mysteriously away from Yoster' Isle with Croco. Nobody
knows what he did with Croco, but we're guessing he's the cause of the
exploding of Barrel Volcano... but that's another story...<BR><BR>

One day a Blue yoshi was born on Yoshi's Island. He emidiatly started
running.
 His parents named him Boshi. When Boshi grew older, He bought some
expensive
 Shades with the money he kept winning at the mushroom derby. Boshi also
bought
 a spiked coller, and cut the toes of his shoes off. He became known as
The Bad Yoshi, all around the Isle. Soon, he let knowone but him race in
the mushroom derby.
 The Yoshis were sad and wished They could race. Then, Yoshi stepped up
and Challenged Boshi. It was a Race no Yoshi would ever Forget. In the
end, Yoshi
 came out in the Lead,and Boshi lost. Then, all the Yoshis including
boshi could 
 race again. Boshi soon got over his losing, and The Yoshis no longer
were afraid of
 him.<BR>
