race: goombis mushiche(scientific)
gender: nutar to common
means: squished mushroom

Goomba used to be a nutar mushroom with a brown top. However, a red
bob-omb blew up and caused the Goomba mushroom (goombis mushiche) to
become alive. Magikoopa caused Goomba to become evil for life. Bowser
and the Goombas took over the mushroom kingdom. A red magikoopa changed
the Goombas grouped up with Mario. They worked together(even though
Mario uses Kuribo the goomba's shoes) to defeat the koopas. Somehow, the
Goombas in a different dimension got hit by squinty eyed purple
mushrooms and the same story happened at the same time. What happened
next? the Red magikoopa turned into a red para-troopa!
