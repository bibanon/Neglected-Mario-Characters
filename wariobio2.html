	OK, where did I leave off...Oh yes, Wario had just lost all his popularity at his school.  No one liked him anymore.  Mario, still finding Wario as a threat to the town of Brooklyngathered a gang of kids to run Wario out of town.  They exiled him from the area, and Wario took up a new life in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  He spent his childhood up to his adulthood, training in the fields of war, waiting for the right moment to strike Mario in vengeance.  As you can tell by his current figure, he also had many trips to Dunkin Donuts.  When he felt he was ready in strength and courage, he left back to Brooklyn, to find the person who was the cause of all his pain-Mario.  But when he reached the neighborhood he grew up at, he found that Mario was no longer living in the area.  After researching on where Mario had gone, Wario found that one day just a few years after he was banished, Mario and his brother Luigi vanished from town.  The police had a statewide search for the brothers, but they were never found.  Wario was crushed!  Mario could now never receive vengeance from his hand!  Still determined, he went to the place where Mario was last seen.  After doing a full investigation, he found the warp pipe the Mario must of fell down (Wario found this easily because he was a plumber once in his life to make a few easy bucks).  Wario, thinking that if Mario was still alive at the bottom of the pipe, he could jump down it himself and crush Mario!  So down Wario went and found himself in the same mysterious world Mario did earlier., <BR>
	Wario took the strangeness of being on another planet quite well, for all he cared about was the suffering of his nemesis Mario.  He took out right away searching for Mario.  After years of eating nothing but mushrooms, he found Mario in a huge castle.  He was at the head of an award ceremony!  A bunch of Mushrooms were honoring him!  All he could hear that they were happy for Mario’s brave efforts in dealing with the “great beast known as Bowser once again.”  Wario cared little of this Bowser fellow, he cared only of REVENGE.  He had to find the one thing Mario cared about and worked hardest at, and DESTROY it.  So he learned of a small island off the main continent of the Mushroom Kingdom that the mushrooms gave Mario as a prize for his heroic efforts (Notice there aren’t any Luigi Lands.  Poor Luigi, them Mushroom bums).  He went to the island and pirated it.  He took over Mario’s castle and claimed it as his own.  He gathered an army of natives of nearby islands, and waited for Mario to come, for if Mario truly cared about his island, he would come.  Once Mario heard that his land was taken over by unknown force, he went alone to figure out what was going on.  Wario waited in his indestructible castle, but Mario crushed the opposing force, and defeated Wario in one to one combat.  Wario was speechless, he was training for years, and Mario still beat him!  Wario started to lose it, tears coming down his eyes.  He could never beat Mario, he was a failure.  Mario, being the nice guy and all, apologized to Wario for being mean to him in the past.  Wario didn’t want his apology, he never wanted to see Mario again.  I think I’ll make Wario’s life a three-parter.  So, tune in next week, same Jay time, same Jay channel.  Next week I will go over Wario’s gold fever as he adventures into something few NC’s get to accomplish-TWO GAMES ALL ABOUT HIMSELF!!!<BR>
