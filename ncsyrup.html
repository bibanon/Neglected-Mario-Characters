<B>Mario Games she has been in:</B><BR>
Well, there not actual Mario games, but there good enough.  Anyway, she only shows up in Wario 	games, for she IS Wario’s arch-nemesis.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land-After Wario’s failure to steal Mario’s treasure, he goes after famed Pirate, Captain Syrup’s gold.<BR>
<LI>Wario Land 2-This time it’s revenge!  After losing her gold, castle and genie to Wario, she gathers her crew to steal it back.<BR>
</UL>

<B>Stories that need to be told:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Captain Syrup’s background-Who is she?  Where did she amass all of that gold?  How the heck did she fit a 60 story gold statue of Princess Toadstool in her castle?<BR>
<LI>Captain Syrup vs. Princess Toadstool-Cat fight, Cat fight!  (I have fifty bucks on Syrup)<BR>
<LI>Wario Land 3: Syrup Land-Notice a pattern yet in Nintendo game boy games?<BR>
<LI>Bowser’s Army vs Wart’s Army vs Smithy’s Army vs Tatanga’s Army vs Syrup’s Army.-Wow.<BR><BR>
</UL>
<B>Forgotten Heroism:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>How did she get all that money???  There had to of been something heroic about that event.<BR>
<LI>Um, she has tried to ward off evil Wario and his obsession with money.  Twice.  That’s more then Mario can say.<BR>
<LI>What ever happened to that cool genie???  That was a cool boss.<BR>
<LI>Imagine the pain and suffering after losing Wario, then seeing his face on the moon!!! (this did happen, try to beat SML3:WL with lots of money.)<BR><BR>
</UL>
<B>Why People Like Captain Syrup:</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>One tough woman-I don’t know.  She’s the one of the only female bosses.  Girls can look up to her for future jobs in crime.<BR>
<LI>She’s got (or use to have) that cool genie-Very cool genie.  I wish I had a genie.<BR>
<LI>Determination-Besides Bowser, she is the ONLY MAJOR boss to appear in MORE THEN ONE GAME,  (I hope I didn’t forget anyone).<BR>
