Status:alive|Height:10 feet, 6 inches|Weight:1000 pounds|<BR>Bowser
was born December 10, 1955 in Manhattan, the son of Agnes Koopa, queen of
Manhattan (1927-) and her king consort, Roddy Koopa (1926-).Prince Bowser
of Manhattan grew up to be leader of this established Koopa gang.He went
on with his gang to the castle residence of the Mushroom King.The gang
overthrew King Toadstool (just like I'm going to overthrow "Slick Willie
from the White House and have the power to pick a new leader) and now
became a king.Bowser had a queen consort just like his mother that has a
king consort.Bowser only had one child, Baby Bowser, from Super Mario
World 2:Yoshi's Island.Bowser's young wife died shortly after having Baby
Bowser.Bowser's "Koopa Kids" are actually Wario's children.Wario (1935-)
got so sick and tired of his baby septuplets, that he sent them to Bowser
so that they could be taken care of by him and turned into brats that
look a lot like Bowser.Before that happened, Bowser and his caused a lot
of mischief in the Mushroom Kingdom when suddenly 2 plumbers from New
York City came along to stop this crisis.The plumbers names were Mario
and Luigi.Mario had been rescuing a true love Pauline from the clutches
of Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong was in the clutches Mario but was saved by
Donkey Kong Jr.Mario was also working with Luigi, his twin, in the city
sewers.Baby Mario and Luigi from Super Mario World 2 are actually Wario's
children just like the Koopa Kids.Wario named the SMW2 twins after his
ex-best friend and his ex-best friend's twin.Wario delivered Baby Luigi
to Baby Bowser, son of Bowser Koopa Sr.He delivered Baby Mario to the
Yoshi's.Now back to the real Mario and Luigi.As I was saying, the real
Mario and Luigi are from New York City and came to stop the Mushroom
Kingdom crisis.The Mario Bros. defeated and overthrew Bowser, rescued
Princess Toadstool, and then Princess Toadstool's father became king
again.But when Mario and Co. took a vacation from Super Mario Bros. and
Super Mario Bros.:The Lost Levels and during that vacation when Mario
dreamt about being in Subcon and fighting off Wart, Bowser adopted
Wario's baby septuplets (now known as the Koopa Kids), built a castle to
live in and took action in the Mushroom Kingdom and sent the Koopa Kids
in airships.The Mario Bros. defeated the Koopa Kids in the 7 worlds
before Dark Land and defeated Bowser in the last world Dark Land and
rescued Princess Toadstool.Princess Toadstool said partly what Toad says
in Super Mario Bros. but then added "Ha Ha Ha, just kidding".Next, Bowser
had a castle for himself and built castles for the Koopa Kids.Mario and
Co. were successful in winning against Bowser and the Koopa Kids.Then,
Bowser accepted to be part of the Super Mario Kart.Then, Bowser, the
Koopa Kids, and the other villains tried win against the Mario Bros. by
taking them through 4 steps in Super Mario All-Stars.It was an
unsuccessful attempt.Then Bowser had other adventures he was featured
after that.There will be updates to this Bowser biography when I travel
to Mexico, China, or Japan to make new Mario
games.<BR>
