Luigi and Mario Mario were born February 14, 1939,
in Brooklyn, twins to Roberto Mario (1905-) and to Maria Mario
(1917-).Luigi, if you didn't notice, is older than Mario by 8
minutes.Their first friend ever was Wario Dawson Schmaltz, a 5-year-old
from Manhattan.Mario and Luigi became friends with Wario in 1940.Brooklyn
around the time when the Mario Bros. were born was ruled by King Walter X
(1859-) and his queen consort Petunia (1863-1970).Petunia died, but
Walter X is still on the throne.Walter X's father Walter VIIII was 112
when he died February 18, 1939, 4 days after the Mario Bros. were
born.The Mario Bros. grew up to be good friends with Wario.Because of
that, when the Mario Bros. were 7, their father planned that they'd move
to Manhattan.They did.On December 14, 1955 when the Mario Bros. were 16,
they were walking along the street when the king and queen of Manhattan
brought out the newly hatched Prince Bowser.The Mario Bros. brought out a
pacifier for their offerings.Wario got good tasty food for the
prince.Wario got the works, a huge pile of gold, diamonds, treasures,
etc.The Mario Bros. got a loaf of Italian bread, that was poisoned.They
thought the bread was regular.They got the bread home and ate it for
dinner.The inside of the bread was totally green.When Mario and Luigi
thought that it was Italian bread filled with melted green vegetables
that would go good with butter, they got sick to their stomachs, fell ill
and nearly died.The doctor said that the Mario Bros. had a case of
poisoning.Their mother and father said that it must be from the bread
they ate.That's how Mario and Luigi got the feeling that Prince Bowser,
learning how to do bad tricks from his parents, was not going to be a
nice guy.After a few years passed, Bowser was growing up.Even though he
was at an age where he could understand, he was mean to the Mario Bros.
and taunted them.Bowser kept doing the same old tricks over and over up
to the time when he was 10 years old.When Bowser was 10, Mario and Luigi
never saw Bowser again.The Mario Bros. were now 26 and  were ready to go
out and travel on adventures.While Luigi was saving the city's sewers
from his enemies, Mario was saving another part of the city to save his
loved Pauline from Donkey Kong.Next, Mario had Donkey Kong in his
clutches but Donkey Kong was saved by Donkey Kong Jr.Luigi was having
trouble fighting off his enemies from the city sewers, so Mario exited
Donkey Kong's part of town and entered the city sewers and fought off the
enemies with Luigi's help.But after not hearing from Bowser for 20 years,
Toadstool (Toad for short), Mushroom World messenger and mushroom
retainer, sent a letter to the twins, telling them that their Kingdom has
been taken over by a gang of Koopa's.The Mario Bros. knew that Koopa was
the royal family of Manhattan's last name.They went farther down than the
city sewers to get to a land just right above the Underworld, "Land of
Hades and the Devils".This land below Manhattan's sewers is called The
Mushroom Kingdom.As Toad, messenger and mushroom retainer was talking
about troubles in his world, The Mario Bros. told about their life doing
stuff like going to the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State
Building.Now you know that the Mario Bros. are from the real world and
not from the Mushroom World, because you know that Baby Mario and Baby
Luigi are Wario's children.Isn't that right? Okay.Let's go on with the
bio.Toad, after hearing what the Mario Bros. said, was over amazed by
hearing about their cultures.The Mario Bros. went on to Bowser's
castle.When they reached the castle, they saw Bowser again.He was all
grown up.He said, "Hi Mario.Hi Luigi.It's so nice to see you again." What
trouble have you caused this time, Bowser?", Mario asked."I've conquered
this castle, which was once the castle residence of the Mushroom
King.There, I overthrew the king and kidnapped his daughter.", Bowser
said."What must we do to get the princess back and the king returned to
the throne?", said Luigi.Bowser replied, "For rescuing the princess, you
need to check the castles of my 7 younger brothers, Yowser, Howser,
Towser, Wowser, Rowser, Powser, Gowser, and my castle, if you couldn't
find the princess in any of my 7 younger brothers' castles.For returning
the king to his castle residence and throne, you need to defeat my 7
younger brothers and me."Mario and Luigi, successfully, beat Bowser and
his 7 younger brothers, rescued the princess, and helped get the king
back to his castle residence and his throne.Bowser had another task
prepared for the Mario Bros.Now, only one of the Mario Bros. could go out
to save Princess Toadstool and put the king once again back on the
throne.Bowser's twin, Dowser was in every castle before the last castle
in the game.Bowser is older than Dowser by 3 minutes.Now, the Mario Bros.
took a vacation.In one part of the vacation, Mario dreamt about being in
Subcon and fighting off a villain known as Wart.But while Mario, Luigi,
and the others vacationed, Bowser had adopted Wario's baby septuplets and
turned them into lizard-like creatures so that they would look a lot like
him.These babies are now known today as the Koopa Kids.Bowser took action
in the Mushroom World and the Mushroom King fell out of power.Bowser
built himself a castle for his new majesty and sent the Koopa Kids in
airships.Toad, mushroom retainer, told the Mario Bros. that 7 kings of 7
worlds have been transformed into different kinds of creatures, which
they were, and he explained the whole story of what happened during the
vacation written in the bio just before Toad's part.They successfully
beat Bowser, the Koopa Kids, and their gang of enemies.Then, the Mario
Bros. vacationed to Dinosaur Land, inhabited by real kinds of dinosaurs,
including Triceratops, T-Rex, Brontosaurus, etc., right below the sewers
of Brooklyn, the site where the Mario Bros. were born.But in the
meantime, during the vacation, Bowser built a castle for himself there
and built castles for the Koopa Kids.Before that, the Mario Bros. picked
up a dinosaur egg from a rare species of dinosaurs.The egg suddenly
cracked and broke open.There he was, Yoshi.It was the beginning of a knew
type of family, a Yoshi family.The Mario Bros. were successful in beating
Bowser and the Koopa Kids.Then Mario, Luigi, Toad, Princess Toadstool,
Yoshi, and some others including Bowser went into Super Mario Kart.Mario
had also been fighting Tatanga in Sarsaland before that.A few months
after the Super Mario Kart races, Wario invaded Mario's castle and made
it his, but Mario conquered all six zones, got all six golden coins, and
conquered the castle.Mario and Luigi had also gone through 4 steps that
they'd taken before in Super Mario All-Stars.As for Super Mario Bros. 2,
Mario had to have the same dream again.A few months before, Mario had
been kidnapped by Bowser and Luigi went out to save him with Yoshi and
return real world artifacts stolen by koopas to their rightful places.A
few days later, Bowser stole real artifacts from certain times and he
then kidnapped Yoshi.Mario went on a long trek through time to restore
those artifacts and rescue Yoshi.The Mario Bros. also appeared in many
other games.The next big event was when Wario came along and bought out
Mario's castle and made it his again.Wario had turned Mario Land into
Wario Land.But I wanted you to let you on a little secret.Luigi, Mario's
twin went to a far off distant land, built a castle, and claimed the
land, "Luigi Land", but in this new Game Boy game, Luigi Land:Wario Land
3, Wario will probably conquer Luigi's castle, make it his, and claim the
castle and the land to be his.He will then own 4 castles.Isn't that
interesting.<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>
Wow, nice bio.  But are the Mario Bros really neglected?  Nevermind.
<BR><BR>

<B>Chargin' Chuck  By, Ramatis</B><BR>
"...Bowser's one and only Football-crazed enemy..."<BR>

Vital Stats:<BR>

Race/Gender: All male,muscle-bound Koopa Troopas covered in Football uniforms.<BR>
Age: Various<BR>
Height: Not very high.<BR>
Weight: Very heavy. Over 300 lbs.<BR>
Games they play other than Football: Baseball<BR>
Likes: Football,Baseball,Koopa,Tackling MARIO<BR>
Hates: The fact that England falls Soccer Football(they hate Soccer),MARIO,losing their helmets and footballs<BR>
49ers or Cowboys: 49ers<BR>

     Chargin' Chucks were originally Koopa Troopas with bigger muscles than all the others.
 When King Koopa hooked up Cable to the Koopa's area,many of them liked to watch football. They were obsessed with it. So they practiced and exercised all day long until they had huge muscles and could fit in football uniforms. Like Lakitu,they were an extremly worthy enemy for MARIO when SMW was made. In fact,they were so tough it took 3 HITS to take 'em out. There were also many other kinds of Chargin' Chucks.
      Clappin' Chucks constantly did jumping jacks whenever you jumped. They often were seen in pairs. Clappin' Chucks were the kind of Chucks that exercised a bit more than most others. So that they thought they could be healthier and stronger than them if they exercised more often.
     Lookout Chucks were the defensive side of the Chargin' Chuck family. They ran around,looking for any meddling plumbers to stomp on and warn others about.
   Splittin' Chucks are the most dangerous kind of Chucks. Splittin' Chucks were insane. So insane that they had three split personalities that often split apart into three different Chucks and caused mounds of trouble for MARIO!
      "Confused" Chucks still remain to wear their football gear,but are now throwing baseballs. Quite possibly the second-most dangerous Chuck. Note that they're jumping a bunch. (boy,those Chucks sure are competitive)
        Diggin' Chucks are simular to "Confused" Chucks. While they still wear football armor,they've put down their football and picked up their shovel and they dig up rocks to toss at MARIO. Note that they do this even when Mario's not around. They must be exercising their arms so that their muscles will be bigger. (Uh,did I mention these Chucks were competitive?)
            Chargin' Chucks are among the most competitive creatures of King Koopa's Arsenal.
Exercising everyday,even attacking is giving them a workout! They're even a worthy enemy for Yoshi! For Yoshi personally doesn't like eating any enemy with athlete's foot!<BR>

"What we have here is a problem to communicate with proper English!"<BR><BR>

<B>Thoughts From Jay</B><BR>

Along time ago in a galaxy far away there was a being named culex.  He would
consume planets as he went bye them.  He was matter and anti-matter.  he
advently went to earth.  Then he relized he couldnt stay there. but he lived
in MOnstro town.  He met Mario.  He challneged him and his friends to a
fight.  He thought he would win.  He almost did.  Then he lost.  He went
aback to his home planet.  Till next time.<BR><BR>
