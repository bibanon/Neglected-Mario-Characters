<B>Other Comments:</B>  This is the troublemaker that keeps your NES from working right.  You know that blue screen that flashes when you try to play an old NES game and it won't work?  That's this character coming between you and the game.  It is a common myth that it is dust that causes the screen to flash, but it is actually this character.<BR>
